I, ROBOT
Screenplay
by
Jeff Vintar
Based on his original screenplay,
“Hardwired,” and the robot stories of
Isaac Asimov
August 2002
INT. LOW-TECH APARTMENT - MORNING
The remarkable thing about this apartment is how unremarkable
it is. Basic furniture. Plain walls. This could be today, or
perhaps a recent yesterday. There is a phonograph, but no
higher electronics. An old television set. But no computer.
An alarm clock rings and keeps ringing until a hand turns it
off. SPOONER rolls on his back and stares up at the ceiling.
He stands inside the shower and lets the water wash over him.
Spooner shaves with a straight edge razor. He rinses it off
underneath the faucet and runs the blade over his face again.
He cooks over his old gas stove. The pan smokes and sizzles.
Spooner methodically fastens a HOLSTER around his torso. He
removes the GUN, checks it, and sets it firmly back in place.
Takes his BADGE from the table. Spooner puts on a long coat,
and straightens the knot of his tie.
EXT. FUTURE CITY STREET - MORNING
SPOONER exits his apartment building. TITLE AND CREDITS begin
over a metal man standing on the sidewalk outside. It turns
around revealing the stylized face of a humanoid ROBOT.
Spooner makes his way through the morning crowd surrounded by
PEOPLE WEARING THEIR COMPUTERS, the hardware shaped into formfitting
modules up and down their bodies, faces adorned with
small screens or sunglasses scrolling data or playing images.
Spooner looks to be the only traditional face in the crowd,
just walking along, his body free of electronics. The jackedin
pedestrians around him move with an almost mechanical
stiffness, while the city’s machines seem the most life-like:
ROBOTS ARE PICKING OUT FRUIT at a market. SERVING CUSTOMERS at
cafes. CLEANING STORE WINDOWS. OPENING DOORS for people.
A lone ROBOT IS WALKING A DOG. The dog stops to inspect a
post. The robot looks down at the animal -- a convincing
imitation of human movement -- and tugs on the leash. The dog
immediately hurries along and they continue on their way.
Spooner is suddenly aware of a ROBOT WALKING BESIDE HIM. He
looks annoyed and increases his pace, losing it in the crowd.
The street is swarming with traffic. BUT NO ONE IS DRIVING.
The dashboards have no steering wheels. Again the people
riding in the cars look almost artificial, not moving at all.
(CONTINUED)
And high up above, an electronic BILLBOARD for U.S. Robotics
runs a series of ads with broadly-smiling humans being served
by robots and machines, with the pitch: The Future is Today!
The cars STOP IN PERFECT UNISON. Spooner crosses the street.
SPOONER’S P.O.V. Directly in front of him, in the crowd, a
CARETAKER ROBOT holds a LITTLE GIRL in its arms. The Girl is
clutching its neck the way she might hold her mother, staring
over the robot’s shoulder at Spooner. She smiles big at him.
Spooner just stares at her. Then he seems to remember what to
do, and tries to return the smile. It doesn’t quite work.
INT. AT THE POLICE STATION - MORNING
SPOONER walks across the squad room. His FELLOW DETECTIVES sit
at impossibly neat high-tech desks with computers set into the
tabletops. But one desk in the middle of the room stands out
in stark contrast. Nothing humming or whirring. A real mess.
The desk could be sent back in time fifty years and fit in just
fine. Here Spooner sits down. Immediately, his old-style
TELEPHONE RINGS. He picks up the receiver and:
SPOONER
Spooner, Homicide.
END OF CREDITS
INT. FEATURELESS METAL CORRIDOR - DAY
An ELEVATOR OPENS delivering SPOONER to a featureless metal
corridor. Slowly, he starts down the hall. His FOOTSTEPS echo
inside the narrow walls. He stops at a set of opposing doors.
Spooner looks over at one, and the other slides open.
INT. LUXURIANT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
SPOONER steps into a room that seems incongruous attached to
that metal hall. Rich woods. Warmly lit. He looks around,
quickly, as if questioning what he sees. His eyes settle on:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. A LONG CONFERENCE TABLE with an OLD MAN
sitting at the far end. He looks like he should be standing at
a blackboard droning on and on in front of a room full of
perplexed students. The Old Man speaks with a German accent.
OLD MAN
Hello there. Please, do come in.
2.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Spooner takes only a small step inside.
OLD MAN (CONT’D)
It’s all right. You can sit. Sit.
Spooner does not sit down. Instead, he watches the Old Man
lift a COFFEE POT and fill a single CUP.
OLD MAN (CONT’D)
Coffee?
SPOONER
(interested in this)
You’re offering me a cup of coffee?
OLD MAN
Yah. But you are to say, “No thank you.”
Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
lips but doesn’t take a sip, looking over the cup at Spooner.
OLD MAN (CONT’D)
Coffee?
SPOONER
No. Thank you.
OLD MAN
As you wish.
The Old Man takes a sip, and returns the cup to the tabletop.
OLD MAN (CONT’D)
Thank you for coming.
SPOONER
Your phone call was...unusual.
The Old Man does not respond. Spooner watches him:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. The Old Man sits at the far end of the long
table. He is absolutely still. There is no movement except
for a whisper of STEAM rising from the top of the coffee pot.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
You wanted to tell me something about
Doctor Hogenmiller. About his death.
OLD MAN
Yah.
SPOONER
What exactly did you want to tell me?
3.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
OLD MAN
I exactly wanted to tell you that his
death was not a suicide.
SPOONER
And why do you say that?
OLD MAN
Why? Because I want you to know it.
SPOONER
Yes. But what specifically led you to the
conclusion that Doctor Hogenmiller did
not commit suicide?
OLD MAN
Specifically? Nothing specifically.
SPOONER
You just have a general sense that it
wasn’t so.
OLD MAN
A general sense. Yah.
Spooner thinks for a moment.
SPOONER
Under normal circumstances that wouldn’t
be enough to warrant an investigation.
OLD MAN
But this is not “normal circumstances,”
is it, Detective Spooner of Homicide?
SPOONER
No. It isn’t.
OLD MAN
Then you will find out who killed Doctor
Hogenmiller. Yah? And you will tell me.
Pause. Spooner watches him:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. The Old Man sits at the far end of the long
table. He is absolutely still. There is no movement except
for a whisper of steam rising from the top of the coffee pot.
SPOONER
If you were murdered, Doctor, I’ll find
out. And I’ll certainly let you know.
The HOLOGRAM OF DOCTOR HOGENMILLER IS GONE. The empty chair
4.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
and a steaming pot of coffee left. A moment later the entire
CONFERENCE ROOM DISAPPEARS. Spooner is standing in front of a
SHORT STUB OF TABLE jutting out from the LARGE VIEW SCREEN.
What looked like a conference room is really a SMALL METAL
CHAMBER that creates the illusion of a room and a long table.
INT. FEATURELESS METAL CORRIDOR - DAY
SPOONER steps from the chamber as a UNIFORMED OFFICER rushes
past. Spooner thinks. Walks in the direction the officer
came. Now he passes TWO MORE POLICE OFFICERS STANDING GUARD.
Spooner steps into an open doorway and looks down:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. The face of that Old Man stares back at
Spooner from the BODY OF DOCTOR HOGENMILLER sprawled on the
floor. His dead eyes wide. A HANDGUN next to his open hand.
INT. HOGENMILLER’S LABORATORY - DAY
SPOONER enters pandemonium. CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS hurry
about scanning the room with HANDHELD DEVICES. Spooner looks
around at the lair of a mad scientist circa the 21st century:
ROBOT BODIES fill the laboratory, most humanoid, still others
designed with multiple arms and legs, some with wheels -- but
all featuring the same tangle of wires bursting out of joints
like gaping wounds. An elaborate MAZE holds a creepy METAL
BUG. Elevated TERMINALS scroll columns of data that float just
outside the screens. Skeletal arms and legs reach down from
the ceiling. A PILE OF DISCARDED ROBOT PARTS in the far
corner. Rows of robot heads stare back with cold empty eyes.
A SUBORDINATE OFFICER sees Spooner and hurries up beside him.
OFFICER
The stiff is Doctor Heinrich Hogenmiller,
sixty-four-years-old. Weapon is a small
caliber .22 registered in his name. The
only means of entry or exit...
(indicating the door)
...is that door, which was secured from
the inside. Seems pretty obvious the guy
locked himself in and took his own life.
SPOONER
I know someone who disagrees with you.
5.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
OFFICER
Yeah? Who’s that?
It takes Spooner a moment. But then he indicates the corpse.
SPOONER
Him.
Spooner leaves the Officer looking confused and starts across
the lab, moving past a row of unfinished robots with exposed
innards, empty eye sockets staring back, as if watching him
pass. The Detective looks increasingly tense as he goes on.
Spooner reaches a wall, waves his hand over a panel, and the
WALL OPENS bathing the room in sunlight. Spooner closes his
eyes a moment, his face relaxing as the sun washes over him.
EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS HEADQUARTERS - DAY
SPOONER stands at one window of a cutting-edge skyscraper
emblazoned with the company name US Robots & Mechanical Men.
INT. FEATURELESS METAL CORRIDOR - DAY
The elevator opens again and a PAIR OF SHAPELY LEGS marches
out. The CLICK OF HIGH HEELS echoes inside the metal walls.
INT. HOGENMILLER’S LABORATORY - DAY
SPOONER hears RAISED VOICES and turns to see an ATTRACTIVE
PROFESSIONAL WOMAN admonishing the TWO OFFICERS at the door.
He starts across the laboratory. Slowly. Studies the Woman.
SPOONER
Is there a problem, Ms...?
He nods at the Guards to let her pass. Spooner looks mildly
surprised as the Woman walks toward him -- then past him --
ignoring the Detective for a moment. She scans the interior.
WOMAN
Calvin. Doctor Calvin.
Spooner hardens his tone a bit in order to get her attention.
SPOONER
What is your field of expertise, Doctor?
6.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Calvin hesitates. But brief enough to perhaps go undetected.
CALVIN
I’m the Chief Psychologist here. I’ve
been asked to serve as your liaison
during the course of the investigation.
She turns around. For a moment, they look one another over.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Where would you like to begin?
SPOONER
We can begin with whether or not he put a
gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
Calvin appears to ignore, or possibly just accept, his tone.
She looks down at the corpse. Her no-nonsense expression
cracks but she quickly composes herself. The TECHNICIANS are
scanning, and LIGHTING EFFECTS play across the lifeless face.
CALVIN
Doctor Hogenmiller was a schizoid
personality who took no pleasure in
social relationships. He rejected people
and engaged in solitary activities
involving machines. As such he was highly
susceptible to depression.
SPOONER
If that was your diagnosis, why didn’t you
see this coming?
Calvin looks at him, as if the answer is obvious.
CALVIN
This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
Seventy-five percent of our employees
fit that description.
SPOONER
Jesus. Are you all so compassionate,
or am I just lucky to have gotten you?
Calvin thinks about that. Keeps her cool. She starts again.
CALVIN
Hogenmiller was one of the founding
fathers of modern robotics. A giant
in the field. Truth is, he did his groundbreaking
work as a young man. Everyone
expected greater things... but those
hopes were never realized.
7.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Calvin takes a few steps deeper into the lab.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
What would it be like to know -- as an
old man -- that you failed to fulfill
the promise of the young man you once
were? Perhaps it was too much to bear.
The Crime Scene Technicians are beginning to pack up their
equipment. The SUBORDINATE OFFICER approaches:
OFFICER
We’re about finished here.
SPOONER
Good. Let’s lock it down.
Spooner hasn’t taken his eyes from Calvin. Pause.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
I spoke to a dead man today. You want
to tell me about that?
CALVIN
The Doctor avoided human contact. His
hologram attended staff meetings in his
place. Took his calls. I suppose he
thought it was all quite funny. It’s a
simple device--
SPOONER
A simple device that called the police.
CALVIN
At the sound of a gunshot, a 911 alert
would be an automatic function.
SPOONER
Does it automatically contact homicide?
CALVIN
We’re talking about a mechanism designed
by Hogenmiller to say provocative things.
To irritate and confound his colleagues.
SPOONER
And you think it’s still doing that.
CALVIN
I’m sorry to say it, Detective, but your
investigation is the result of our dead
man messing with your head. This was
suicide. Regrettable. But a suicide.
8.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
TWO MEN FROM THE CORONER’S OFFICE enter holding a GURNEY that
resembles a black coffin. Spooner gestures for them to wait.
SPOONER
When you want to find out how a dead body
got that way, Doctor, you ask: How many
shots were fired? From what distance?
Where did the bullets enter the victim?
Spooner bends over the body. Studies it.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Here we have a single shot fired at close
range through the mouth into the brain.
The murder weapon is present and in close
proximity to the outstretched hand of the
deceased, who suffered from depression.
You’re right. Everything about this case
says suicide. It is absolutely textbook.
Spooner rises to his feet. Short pause.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Even people who live a life of logic and
precision are rarely so perfect in their
deaths.
CALVIN
I don’t understand, Detective. You’re
saying this suicide would be more
convincing to you -- if it was less of
a suicide?
SPOONER
I’m saying that this crime scene has no
...personality.
Spooner nods at the Coroner’s Men. They lower the box over the
corpse, and when they lift it the body is inside. Calvin
watches them exit. She can’t quite mask her frustration now:
CALVIN
Surely you don’t believe there’s
something sinister going on here?
The Technicians work the control panels and start the process
of powering down the facility. SECTIONS OF THE LABORATORY
DARKEN one-by-one, and the background humming begins to fade.
Spooner looks at her. And follows the body out.
SPOONER
I always find murder sinister, Doctor.
9.
CONTINUED: (3)
INT. FEATURELESS METAL CORRIDOR - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN step into the hall. The TECHNICIANS exit
and TWO OFFICERS seal the door with an impenetrable-looking
HIGH-TECH LOCKING MECHANISM that engages with a loud DOOOOOM.
Spooner looks relieved. As if he is glad to be out of there.
CALVIN
When can we expect access to the lab?
Spooner walks away, leaving her with no choice but to follow.
SPOONER
This is a police investigation. You can
expect to get in there when it’s over.
CALVIN
We’re used to receiving more cooperation
from city authorities.
They step up to the ELEVATOR. It opens and a ROBOT EMERGES.
Spooner was about to enter but pulls back. Looking irritated
as the robot lumbers past. Calvin sees this. Considers him.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Maybe you personally don’t believe in
the work we do here.
SPOONER
You people do what you do. Then it’s
up to the rest of us to make sense out
of the world we all wake up in.
INT. FEATURELESS METAL ELEVATOR - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN step inside the elevator and:
CALVIN
Hector?
A YELLOW CIRCLE appears, hovering just above the surface of the
wall. Like a LARGE SMILEY BUTTON that is SLEEPING. Now the
two small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES, and the thin mouth
expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Let’s help the Detective see things a bit
more clearly. You know where to take us.
The mouth of the face moves in sync with a GENTLE MALE VOICE.
10.
(CONTINUED)
HECTOR
Yes, Doctor Calvin.
The elevator HUMMMMMS as it starts to descend. Spooner and
Calvin ride in silence. On the wall, the strange yellow face
continues to smile at them. A few moments pass. A few more.
Spooner begins to look uncomfortable. He glances at the wall
...and sees Hector smiling back. Spooner does his best to
ignore the computer. Can’t. Looks back at the smiling face:
SPOONER
You look like a very...
(short pause)
...happy computer.
And the thing answers, smiling wide.
HECTOR
Thank you.
EXT. LARGE CENTRAL ATRIUM - DAY
The elevator opens on an enormous atrium that runs the center
of the skyscraper. It is a marvel of utopian thinking. Lush
greenery integrated with an edgy modern architectural design.
ROBOTS tend to the trees. The glass on all sides reveals the
BUSTLING HALLS AND OFFICES of U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men.
SPOONER and CALVIN make their way down a slowly winding path.
CALVIN
When this company first started, we were
manufacturing at the unremarkable rate of
three robots a week. And now look at us.
Today’s children will never know a world
without robots.
SPOONER
There are a growing number of unemployed
human beings who don’t seem to find that
prospect so appealing.
CALVIN
When compared with robot workers, humans
have several distinct disadvantages. We
need to breathe. And eat. We require
shelter and clothing. We demand payment
for the labor we do, and at the end of a
work day, each of us expects to be alive.
11.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
They pass some ROBOTS moving in the other direction down the
path. The mechanisms obediently stop and stiffly step to the
side, making room for Spooner and Calvin. Spooner eyes them.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Our robots have already begun paving the
way for colonization of the moon and Mars -
- without endangering a single human
life. The first fire-fighting models are
saving lives in twenty-one major cities.
Soon medical robots will be performing
micro-surgeries never believed possible.
Every day our machines do more and more of
the labor that enables human society to
function, and flourish.
SPOONER
Leaving people to do what, Doctor?
CALVIN
After a natural period of adjustment,
leaving them to engage in the higher
pursuits that make life worth living.
They reach a door...and a ROBOT opens it for them.
INT. BUILDING SECURITY CENTER - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN enter a security center with a hundred- plus
screens currently running CORRIDOR SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE.
CALVIN
Hector. Roll surveillance 7887.
On the far wall the SMILING FACE OF HECTOR appears as before:
HECTOR
Yes, Doctor Calvin.
Immediately every screen in the room displays the FEATURELESS
METAL CORRIDOR that leads to the crime scene. Spooner turns.
Looks around at the countless images.
SPOONER
What the hell is this?
CALVIN
Approximately the last thirty seconds
of Doctor Hogenmiller’s life.
The elevator opens as DOCTOR HOGENMILLER steps into the hall.
From every conceivable angle. Long shots and medium shots.
12.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
High angles and low angles. Close-ups of everything from his
eyes to his shoes. His face is composed but tight. Intense.
Spooner watches the laboratory door open to admit him. The
interior is visible, but only briefly. Hogenmiller steps in.
The door slides shut behind him. A moment passes. A few
more. Suddenly, a GUNSHOT ECHOES through the metal corridor.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Of course, we’ll make these surveillance
tapes available to the Department. But
we’ve already gone over them thoroughly.
I assure you that no one enters the lab at
any time except for Hogenmiller, and
after the gunshot, no one leaves. Now I
don’t pretend to be a Homicide detective
...but would you mind telling me how we
could have a murder without a murder-er?
Spooner looks at her noncommittally. He thinks for a moment.
SPOONER
Hector, can you fast-forward, please.
The hundred-plus screens around them all FAST-FORWARD, and
soon POLICE OFFICERS enter the frame moving at an accelerated
rate. They struggle to force open the lab door, then rush
through in a blur. And those CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS appear.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Thank you, Doctor. I admire rigorous
thinking.
Calvin looks surprised, but pleased. About to respond when:
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Of course your conclusion’s premature.
CALVIN
Excuse me?
Spooner steps toward a bank of screens. Sees a FAST-FORWARD
VERSION OF HIMSELF enter the lab. An IMAGE OF CALVIN enters.
SPOONER
No murderer entered or exited the scene of
the crime. This leads you to deduce there
was no murder, but you’ve ignored the
other possibility.
And he turns back to Calvin.
13.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER (CONT’D)
The killer has always been there...
(short pause)
...and never left.
CALVIN
You’re trying to tell me a murderer has
been hiding in the lab the entire time?
SPOONER
Stop the recording, Hector.
(back to Calvin)
If I’m right, the killer’s still there.
The RECORDINGS ARE ALL PAUSED at the exact moment Spooner and
Calvin were standing outside watching the Two Officers secure
the lab door with the IMPENETRABLE-LOOKING LOCKING MECHANISM.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
We locked it in.
INT. FEATURELESS METAL CORRIDOR - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN step up. Spooner holds his BADGE in front
of that locking mechanism, and it RELEASES A SERIES OF BOLTS.
SPOONER’S AND CALVIN’S P.O.V. The laboratory is dark and
quiet. Just the low HUMMING of several terminals casting an
eerie illumination over robot heads, and gutted metal bodies.
INT. DOCTOR HOGENMILLER’S LAB - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN re-enter. Calvin stops just inside the
door, watching Spooner move into the room. He looks around.
Slowly he walks past the same ROW OF UNFINISHED ROBOT BODIES as
before. Empty eye sockets stare back, as if watching him.
Spooner stops. Sees that MAZE holding the METAL INSECT. He
approaches the maze. Bends over it. Spooner gets closer and
The ROBOT BUG COMES TO LIFE and leaps forward. Spooner
immediately pulls back as the insect scurries off through the
maze, its antenna detecting the barriers, its multiple legs
propelling its body with a series of WHIRS. The robot makes it
through the maze and reaches the other end. Now it STOPS.
Calvin leans against the door skeptically, crossing her arms
in front of her chest. Spooner frowns a bit but keeps going.
Now he sees something across the lab.
14.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER’S P.O.V. A COMPLETE ROBOT BODY hangs with the other
gutted bodies. It is humanoid. Four complete limbs visible.
All of its joints intact. A head rests atop the torso, at a
slight angle, its eye lenses staring out over the laboratory.
Spooner slowly walks over. The robot hangs slightly above him,
the metal head staring down, as if watching his every move.
Spooner reaches inside his coat and takes out his GUN.
He moves closer. Spooner pokes at the body and THE HEAD
TUMBLES OFF THE TORSO ONTO THE FLOOR. It rolls and comes to a
rest, its two eye lenses staring blankly up at the ceiling.
Calvin looks as if she is trying to hold it in. Then LAUGHS.
CALVIN
I’m sorry. I didn’t intend to laugh.
Spooner puts his gun away. Calvin presses her lips together to
stop another wave of amusement.
Spooner walks past a MOUND OF ROBOT PARTS in the far corner.
Arms and legs. Pieces of indistinguishable metal. A robot
head that looks like it was tossed haphazardly onto the pile.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
I feel it’s my obligation to point out
that a robot cannot murder a human being.
Not if it was ordered to kill. Not even
if it was protecting its own existence.
This is exactly what the Three Laws of
Robotics were designed to prevent.
Spooner stops and turns around. Starts back toward the pile.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
A robot would destroy itself before it
allowed a human being to come to harm.
Spooner kicks at the pile dislodging a few small metal parts.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Are you hearing me, Detective? A robot
cannot hurt you.
Spooner moves his foot to kick at the mound again WHEN THE PILE
FLIES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. Robot parts strike the wall and
clatter across the floor in a deafening cacophony of metal as
THE ROBOT THAT WAS HIDING UNDER THE JUNK STANDS UP. Its metal
hand reaches inside Spooner’s coat. Too fast for a human
being. It retracts with his gun. The Robot raises itself to
its full height POINTING THE GUN AT SPOONER’S HEAD.
15.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Calvin cannot believe what she is seeing. Not frightened so
much as absolutely fascinated.
Spooner stares down the long barrel into two illuminated eye
lenses resting inside a roughly-sculpted and grim metal face.
SPOONER
Move away from the door, Doctor. Now.
Calvin moves away from the door, not taking her eyes from the
Robot, watching its every move almost clinically.
The Robot backs toward the exit in a convincing imitation of a
desperate man seeking escape. The tremulous shaking of the
gun. The darting looks between Spooner and Calvin as it
nervously watches them both. Its movements so fluid. Human.
The Robot backs up against the door still pointing the gun at
them. Then it quickly touches a wall panel. The door slides
open and the Robot steps through into the CORRIDOR, slamming
its metal hand onto the exterior door panel to close them in.
Spooner rushes to the door, and takes position on one side. He
pulls a BACK-UP GUN from around his ankle and removes a
CARTRIDGE. Calvin steps over, her eyes fixated on that door:
CALVIN
How did you know it was under there?
SPOONER
If I was made out of metal, and didn’t
want anyone to find me, I’d hide under
a pile of junk.
Calvin turns to him and seems to realize what he’s doing for
the first time when he pulls a LARGER CARTRIDGE from his belt
and inserts it into the handle with a KL-KLATCH.
CALVIN
Don’t be ridiculous. There’s no reason to
shoot at it.
Calvin matter-of-factly touches the control panel. The door
opens and she marches out into the open before he can stop her.
A stunned Spooner points his gun. Ready to cover her:
SPOONER’S AND CALVIN’S P.O.V. At the far end of the hall the
Robot turns at the sound of the door. Its movements are so
quick. Fluid. So human. It raises its own gun to fire and
CALVIN (CONT’D)
STOP. Terminate current program.
The Robot freezes in place. Does not move.
16.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Lower the weapon. Stand at rest.
The Robot awkwardly lowers its arm to its side, and stands up
straight, as if unable to ignore the command. For the first
time its movements look stiff and robotic. Like a mechanism.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Do not move again until you receive a
direct command from me.
Spooner is still tensed. Ready to fire. He looks surprised.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
It’s easy to assign human motivation to a
machine when it’s made in our image. But
this is not one of your “fugitives”
attempting to escape. This is a robot.
She turns away from the Robot and looks at Spooner:
CALVIN (CONT’D)
A simple command will reveal its behavior
for what it is: clever programming. The
illusion of self interest and free will.
We were never in real danger, Detective.
It still does not move. Finally, Spooner lowers his gun. He
stares down the length of the corridor at the immobile Robot.
CLOSE-UP of the ROBOT’S HAND hanging down at its side. ONE OF
ITS FINGERS TWITCHES. Like a nervous tick.
Spooner grabs the unsuspecting Calvin and forces her down as
the Robot raises its arm and FIRES. Spooner and Calvin slide
across the laboratory floor as BULLETS RICOCHET around them.
The Robot FIRES one last time as the ELEVATOR OPENS. It runs
on. Its movements are fluid again. Human. Holding the gun up
near its roughly-sculpted face. The elevator doors shut.
The laboratory is quiet again. Spooner lies on the floor on
top of a stunned Calvin. She suddenly realizes that she’s
still clutching him, and lets go. Spooner looks down at her:
SPOONER
Well, that was a very convincing illusion
of somebody shooting at us.
17.
CONTINUED: (3)
INT. INSIDE THE ELEVATOR - DAY
THE ROBOT stands just inside the doors. Even without human
features it looks identifiably nervous, shifting its weight
from foot to foot. Its long metal fingers uncurl, then wrap
back around the grip of the gun. And suddenly, it stiffens.
The Robot spins around pointing the gun at THE OTHER ROBOT in
the elevator. The Other Robot is still. Primitive. It shows
no reaction. Just stands there like a dumb mechanism.
The Robot hesitates. Then lowers the gun. Its head moves,
very subtly, looking over this Other Robot from head to toe.
INT. BACK INSIDE THE LAB - DAY
SPOONER rises and helps CALVIN up. She calls out to the air.
CALVIN
Hector?!
The YELLOW CIRCLE appears near the wall. Like a LARGE SMILEY
BUTTON. The mouth moving in sync with HECTOR’S GENTLE VOICE:
HECTOR
I took the liberty of alerting building
security .003 seconds after the first
shot was fired. I hope you don’t mind.
SPOONER
I’m going after it--
HECTOR
The elevator containing the errant robot
is now descending to the lobby, where it
will be met by a team of armed security
personnel already in position.
Spooner thinks about it, and takes a step back into the room.
They watch Hector’s face APPEAR TO FALL ASLEEP. The round
black eyes flatten into tiny slits, and the mouth compresses.
Moments pass before Hector opens its eyes again. And smiles:
HECTOR (CONT’D)
Congratulations, Detective. The robot
has been apprehended.
18.
INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN emerge from the elevator into the lobby, and
push through a crowd of SPECTATORS straining to see. They
reach a group of ARMED SECURITY GUARDS surrounding a ROBOT
HOLDING A GUN. It is malfunctioning. Stopping and starting
again. Joints WHINING. It is not the right robot.
Calvin doesn’t know what to say. And Spooner starts for the
door. Faster and faster. He rushes out onto the street and
EXT. A BUSY SIDEWALK - DAY
A ROBOT walks past. Then ANOTHER. MORE AND MORE ROBOTS are
visible up and down the block, mixed in with the PEDESTRIANS.
SPOONER stands there, helplessly, in the middle of the crowd.
CALVIN joins him, breathless. She looks up and down the
street. Spooner watches her now:
SPOONER
You told me you were a psychologist. That
wasn’t the whole truth, was it?
CALVIN
I never said I treated human beings.
They lock eyes for a moment.
INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN re-enter, moving quickly across the lobby.
An EXECUTIVE pushes through the crowd:
EXECUTIVE
You have some explaining to do, Doctor!
CALVIN
(ignoring his tone)
Detective Spooner, meet Alfred Lanning,
our Head of Research.
LANNING
I just broke the news to the Board of
Directors that Hogenmiller blew his
brains out, and now I have to go back and
tell them he may have been shot by a robot
-- that you just let get away?!
19.
(CONTINUED)
Calvin doesn’t like the brow-beating, but just keeps walking.
LANNING (CONT’D)
Do you have any idea what’s going to
happen when this gets out? My god, it
could ruin us. I’m making this your
responsibility, Doctor, you hear me?!
Spooner and Calvin squeeze between the SECURITY GUARDS and
enter the circle. The PRIMITIVE ROBOT turns toward them with a
violent jerk. Its voice SPUTTERS:
PRIMITIVE ROBOT
Malfunction. This unit is not...ZZZ...
programmed to carry...ZZZ...firearms.
The robot is holding the gun incorrectly, with the barrel
pointing up at the ceiling, like its hands are really not
designed for it. Spooner reaches out and takes his gun back.
PRIMITIVE ROBOT (CONT'D)
This unit must obey orders--
Calvin is shaken. Her voice unable to mask it.
CALVIN
Attention. Who ordered you to hold
this firearm? Was it a robot?
PRIMITIVE ROBOT
This unit is not programmed to obey
...ZZZ...an order given by a robot.
CALVIN
But you did obey the orders of another
robot. Why? Explain--
Spooner has had enough of this madhouse:
SPOONER
(impatiently)
Who gave you the goddamn gun?!
PRIMITIVE ROBOT
A mmmmmmmZZZZZZZZ--
The robot SPUTTERS. Spooner and Calvin wait. The Security
Guards and Spectators wait. You could hear a pin drop in the
lobby when the answer finally comes:
PRIMITIVE ROBOT (CONT’D)
A metal man.

INT. ON THE EVENING NEWS - MONTAGE
A NEWS ANCHOR addresses her television audience with DAILY
STOCK MARKET RESULTS displayed over her shoulder:
NEWS ANCHOR 1
Wall Street was reeling today from the
apparent suicide of U.S. Robotic’s top
designer Doctor Heinrich Hogenmiller--
A SECOND ANCHOR continues with FOOTAGE OF ALFRED LANNING
rushing past a row of REPORTERS THRUSTING MICROPHONES at him.
NEWS ANCHOR 2
...with no official statement yet from
the company...
The U.S. ROBOTICS TOWER appears beside the THIRD NEWS ANCHOR:
NEWS ANCHOR 3
...and numerous unconfirmed reports of a
robot -- yes, robot -- fleeing the scene.
INT. LIEUTENANT’S OFFICE - EVENING
The door slides open and SPOONER enters. Sees the LIEUTENANT
pacing. A pair of computerized GLASSES overpower his face, and
he WEARS HIS COMPUTER, the hardware shaped to fit over his
shoulder, in the small of his back, and around his waist.
The Lieutenant is engaged in a call with an IMAGE OF THE
COMMISSIONER running on both of his eye lenses. Now he sees
Spooner and gestures for him to wait. He doesn’t look happy:
LIEUTENANT
Yes, sir. I understand. No, we wouldn’t
want that. I’ll speak to him as soon as
he reports in, of course, sir. Good-bye.
The Lieutenant’s fingers work the small PALM MOUSE in his hand,
terminating the phone call.
LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
That was the Commissioner. Seems he just
got off the phone with some big-wigs over
at U.S. Robotics who were none too happy.
SPOONER
Yeah. Well I guess killer robots are bad
for business.
21.
(CONTINUED)
The Lieutenant takes a swig of COFFEE and empties his cup. A
SENSOR ON THE CUP BLIPS and activates a COFFEE MACHINE that
automatically brews more. He walks over and refills the cup.
LIEUTENANT
What’s bad for U.S. Robotics is bad for
this city. And I don’t want to hear any
more talk about killer robots, you hear?
We don’t know for sure what happened.
Officially this errant mechanism is not
a murder suspect.
SPOONER
Then what is it?
LIEUTENANT
Missing evidence.
The Lieutenant works his palm mouse, and METROPOLITAN MAPS AND
DATA run on the interior of his lenses. He scrolls down.
LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
We’re running a series of simulations to
devise an appropriate search pattern--
SPOONER
I don’t think you’re going to find that
thing by looking in your little screen.
LIEUTENANT
(irritated)
You know what you are, don’t you? You’re
a...a.... What the hell is that word?
The Lieutenant manipulates his mouse and a THESAURUS scrolls
up his glasses. The letters “msinorhcana” flash.
LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
Anachronism! That’s it. You’re a thing
out of its time.
SPOONER
I know what it means. Thank you.
LIEUTENANT
It’s not a compliment, goddamnit.
The Lieutenant steps back toward his chair. A SENSOR ON HIS
SHOE BLIPS. The CHAIR ROLLS AWAY FROM THE DESK AND SWIVELS
into position. He sits down. Spooner watches, with a frown.
LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
What do you think of this Doctor Calvin?
22.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
I’m trying not to.
LIEUTENANT
Detective, you’re going to cooperate with
U.S. Robotics. And if that means
cooperating with her, then you’ll do it--
Spooner starts to protest, but:
LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
Damn it, Del. This is a big one. For
once, try not to piss everybody off. You
know how many people have robots in their
homes? We could have wide-scale panic on
our hands. You’re going to do whatever it
takes to find that thing. And fast.
Spooner just stands there. When the Lieutenant is done, he
moves to the door. It slides open. Spooner turns back once.
SPOONER
This is it, you know. From now on we’re
going to miss the good old days.
LIEUTENANT
What good old days?
SPOONER
When people were killed by other people.
EXT. ROOF OF THE STATION - EVENING
SPOONER stands at a chain link fence encircling the roof of the
police station. With even the most futuristic buildings
reduced to silhouettes at twilight, this setting seems almost
timeless. Spooner holds the fence. Looks out over the city.
At the sound of FOOTSTEPS, he turns, but not all the way.
Enough to show CALVIN he knows she’s there:
SPOONER
Hello, Doctor.
CALVIN
They told me I might find you here.
Calvin steps up beside him. Looks through the fence. Pause.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
You don’t seem surprised to see me.
23.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
Should I be? For the first time in its
history U.S. Robotics is running scared.
CALVIN
Really. What exactly are we scared of?
SPOONER
That people will find out the Three Laws
of Robotics are a big lie.
CALVIN
A big lie. Is that right?
SPOONER
“A robot may not injure a human being,
or through inaction allow a human being to
come to harm.”
CALVIN
The first and most important law. So?
SPOONER
So a robot opens a window. Ten minutes
later, I fall out of it and die. I was
just killed by a robot, wasn’t I?
Spooner steps a bit away from the fence. Calvin watches him.
CALVIN
That’s a ridiculous example. The robot
couldn’t possibly have known you’d fall
out of the window when it opened it.
SPOONER
Then the First Law of Robotics should
read: a robot won’t intentionally harm
you -- or allow you to be harmed to the
extent of its limited knowledge.
CALVIN
Well, everyone understands that.
SPOONER
Do they? That’s not what you advertise.
You create the perception that robots are
infallible, and you’ve gotten away with
it, but it won’t last forever. Not in the
face of a homicide. And then what? Your
whole world is turned upside-down.
CALVIN
It’s your world too, isn’t it?
24.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
That seems to irritate him.
SPOONER
Why don’t you say what you came here
to say?
CALVIN
You found the robot once using your
natural instincts. I have every reason to
believe you’ll find it again. But
you can’t bring it in without my help.
SPOONER
I sense you’re getting to the point.
CALVIN
Yes. I’m going with you.
SPOONER
And why would I let you do that?
CALVIN
I don’t communicate with robots by
typing on a keyboard. If they’re not
working right, I talk to them, and
fix the problem verbally. I call it
Robo-Psychology.
SPOONER
And that’s your plan. You’re going to
talk to it. That thing is dangerous--
CALVIN
If the robot shot Hogenmiller, there’s
a logical explanation. I will find it.
SPOONER
Let’s be clear here. I don’t give a
damn about your laws of robotics. I
want to catch a murderer.
CALVIN
Then you’re going to be disappointed. The
robot may act like a man, but there’s no
motive here. This is not a murder,
Detective -- it’s a malfunction.
That makes Spooner stop. Think. And when he turns to her,
Calvin looks perplexed at his growing grin:
SPOONER
Good work, Doctor. You did it again.
25.
CONTINUED: (2)
INT. POLICE GARAGE - NIGHT
TIRES SQUEAL as Spooner’s CAR races through a parking garage.
INT. SPOONER’S CAR - NIGHT
SPOONER drives with his hands on a STEERING WHEEL. CALVIN sits
big-eyed in the passenger seat holding on for dear life.
SPOONER
You agree this robot acts like a man.
CALVIN
All robots are programmed to act like men.
Watch out!
Spooner swerves around another car in the garage and speeds
down the ramp to the next level below. Calvin is terrified.
SPOONER
How does a man hide from the cops?
CALVIN
Do you always drive manually?
SPOONER
He tries to blend into the crowd.
CALVIN
Look, I know where you’re going with this.
The robot may try to hide among the
general mechanical population. So what?
Where do we start looking?
They take another ramp. The tires SQUEAL. Calvin holds on.
SPOONER
You said it. This is a malfunctioning
robot. Well, a robot is a computer on two
legs, right? And computers are very
literal. So where would our robot go --
not just to blend into the crowd -- but to
literally be indistinguishable from the
robot standing next to it?!
Calvin thinks. And realizes:
CALVIN
The robot has the outer shell of a model
NS-2. There’s only one place in the city
with a concentrated number of Nestors.
26.
EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - NIGHT
The CAR hurls from the garage exit, and races down the block.
CALVIN (V.O.)
Come on, let’s move. Can’t this thing
go any faster?!
EXT. ROBOT ASSEMBLY PLANT - NIGHT
A sprawling assembly plant dominates an industrial wasteland.
INT. THE SECRETARY’S DESK - NIGHT
SPOONER and CALVIN step up. Look down at the ROBOT WEARING A
BLONDE WIG AND A RED DRESS sitting behind the desk. The wig is
crooked on its square head.
SPOONER
We’re here to see the night foreman.
The robot stands stiffly, opens the door to the office, and
enters. Spooner and Calvin share a look. The door opens again
and the NIGHT MAN rushes out, surprised to see anyone:
NIGHT MAN
Uh. Hi. I’m Binder, uh, the night man.
I’m the only man here. At night. So...
I’m the night man. Heh.
The robot steps out of the office and stands just behind him.
The Night Man quickly snatches the blonde wig off the robot’s
head and hides it behind his back. He GIGGLES uncomfortably.
INT. THE FOREMAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT
SPOONER and CALVIN lean over the shoulder of the NIGHT MAN and
watch him key information into a dusty computer terminal.
CALVIN
We’re looking for a lost robot. Can you
tell us how many Nestors you have here?
NIGHT MAN
I can tell you without looking. Fifty.
We always have fifty. Last week we had
fifty. Yesterday we had fifty...
27.
(CONTINUED)
And he frowns at the screen. Stops hitting the keys. Pause.
NIGHT MAN (CONT'D)
...today we have fifty-one.
INT. TRANSPORTATION DOCK - NIGHT
A STORAGE COMPARTMENT OPENS and 51 ROBOTS MARCH OUT in strict
formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. Like a
metal army. Each one indistinguishable from the next one. The
sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS REVERBERATES through the large
transport dock as the 51 Robots organize themselves in a
straight line and stop to await orders. Stiff. Motionless.
SPOONER, CALVIN, and the NIGHT MAN watch from a CONTROL BOOTH
window, looking up and down the row, unable to distinguish one
from another. EVERY ONE OF THEM LOOKS LIKE THE FUGITIVE.
SPOONER
I hope you have an idea.
CALVIN
We could interview each one individually,
cross-referencing their responses to
detect any anomalies. If we work around
the clock we should have the right robot
in two or three weeks.
They share a look. Then Calvin scans the dock. She sees a
LARGE METAL TRANSPORT TRAILER HANGING FROM THE CEILING CRANE.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Of course, we could try something a bit
more expedient.
CUT TO:
A single FOLDING CHAIR has been placed in the center of the
transport dock under the shadow of the large trailer HANGING
ABOVE IT. Spooner and Calvin stand before the row of Robots.
SPOONER
Please. Explain this to me. Again.
CALVIN
We have fifty robots here that cannot kill
a human being, or allow a human being to
come to harm. And one that apparently
can.
She looks at the chair. Then up at the trailer.
28.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN (CONT'D)
Fifty of the robots should attempt to save
my life. The one that doesn’t is our
man...so to speak. Try and relax.
Spooner watches her walk off. Calvin sits down in the shadow
of the enormous trailer dangling above. She glances at the
Night Man in the control booth, and positions a tiny HEADSET.
CALVIN’S P.O.V. A row of 51 grim-looking Robots stand there
like metal statues, each one identical.
Spooner and Calvin share one last look, and she says, calmly:
CALVIN (CONT’D)
(into the mike)
Drop it.
The TRAILER DROPS TOWARD THE FLOOR and the ROBOTS RUN TOWARD
CALVIN like a row of linebackers rushing the quarterback.
Their metal footsteps are DEAFENING and
The THICK CORD OF THE CEILING CRANE goes taut and the TRAILER
STOPS above her head. It swings. The ROBOTS STOP IN UNISON
and immediately straighten into their stiff resting position.
Spooner does not look pleased. Calvin slowly rises from her
chair. Fascinated. Staring at 51 ROBOTS STANDING RIGHT IN
FRONT OF HER. Every one of them moved.
CUT TO:
The ceiling crane RAISES THE TRAILER high above the facility.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
For fifty of them, running to my rescue
was an automatic response. But for our
robot it was a calculated decision.
SPOONER
You mean the damn thing is pretending.
CALVIN
Yes. Voluntary actions are slower than
automatic responses in human beings, but
not in robots. I was hoping we would
catch it by surprise. Clearly we didn’t.
Spooner watches the trailer lock into place. Then looks down
at the WALL OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT flowing between TWO POSTS.
Calvin looks over the jury-rigged set-up.
29.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN (CONT’D)
We drop the trailer. Although they may
understand after the first test that I’m
not in any real danger, the fifty normal
NS-2s will have no choice but to run to my
rescue -- even if it means destroying
themselves in the process.
SPOONER
And the robot that stays behind is the one
that values its own existence over human
life. Brilliant, Doctor. If it works.
CALVIN
A simple application of the Three Laws
of Robotics, Detective.
Calvin gestures toward the booth. As before, the STORAGE
COMPARTMENT OPENS and those 51 ROBOTS MARCH OUT in formation.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Let’s just hope we can get that current
turned off before we fry several million
dollars worth of perfectly good robots.
Spooner moves off to the side. Takes out his GUN. Watches
from the perimeter. Calvin sits down in the chair as before.
CALVIN’S P.O.V. The 51 identical Robots face her from the
other side of the electrical barrier.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Drop it.
The TRAILER DROPS TOWARD THE FLOOR. At the last moment the
cord of the crane goes taut and the TRAILER STOPS. Swinging.
Calvin immediately rises from her chair. Looking like she
can’t believe it. Spooner lowers his gun.
The 51 Robots are still standing far off, in an orderly line,
where they were before. NOT ONE TOOK A SINGLE STEP FORWARD.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Current off!
The ELECTRICAL BARRIER DISAPPEARS and Calvin steps through.
She faces the long line of Robots. Then picks one at random:
CALVIN (CONT’D)
You. Explain yourself! A human being was
in danger.
30.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
ROBOT 1
This unit would have been destroyed upon
contact with the barrier. Rescue of the
human being was not possible--
CALVIN
You must not allow a human being to come
to harm through your inaction. Explain!
ROBOT 1
If it is not possible to save a human
being, then that human being could be
categorized as already deceased.
Calvin stares at it. Shocked. She moves to the next robot:
CALVIN
And you? What do you say?
ROBOT 2
If it is not possible to save a human
being, then that human being could be
categorized as already deceased.
Calvin moves down the line toward a third.
ROBOT 3
If it is not possible to save--
Calvin turns before it finishes. She looks frustrated, and a
little scared. She steps back to address them:
CALVIN
This is not your original thinking. I
want to know where this concept came from.
Who told you this?
51 Robots answer in unison. Their mechanical voices resound:
51 ROBOTS
ONE OF US.
CALVIN
Which one?
51 ROBOTS
ONE OF US.
CALVIN
That is not satisfactory. Which one?!
51 ROBOTS
ONE OF US.
31.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
Spooner steps up beside her. Calvin looks shaken.
SPOONER
What the hell’s going on here?!
CALVIN
It anticipated our next move. It talked
to the others and introduced a new way of
thinking so it wouldn’t be detected.
SPOONER
(yelling to the booth)
Move the trailer above the robots. Now!
Through the window of the booth, the Night Man can be seen
working the equipment. The TRAILER RISES TOWARD THE CEILING.
CALVIN
What are you doing? You can’t--
SPOONER
(to the robots)
Do not move. That’s an order!
CALVIN
I have everything under control here.
SPOONER
It doesn’t look that way to me.
The trailer MOVES INTO POSITION above the Robots.
CALVIN
You have to be patient. These are not
men. They’re machines--
SPOONER
And in a moment they’ll be scrap metal.
He gestures. The TRAILER DROPS. 50 Robots stand waiting for
the end. BUT ONE OF THEM LEAPS FROM THE MIDDLE ROW. It hits
the floor and rolls, in one fluid motion, rising to its feet.
The Robot stands tensed and ready to flee. Like any cornered
human fugitive. It is uncanny. The Robot hesitates. Looks.
The TRAILER IS SWINGING ABOVE THE HEADS of the other Robots.
It never hit. The Robot turns to Spooner and Calvin. Their
expressions make it clear this had been their plan all along.
CALVIN
Gotcha.
32.
CONTINUED: (4)
(CONTINUED)
The Robot turns and runs. Spooner raises his gun to fire, but
it is too fast. The terrified Night Man ducks down as the
Robot leaps into the control booth SHATTERING the window.
The Robot lands on its feet, races through the booth, and out
the door. Spooner and Calvin rush in:
SPOONER
We can’t let it out of this building.
Calvin hurries to a console and works the controls. Spooner
helps the Night Man rise shakily onto his feet, then looks
around at the monitors showing SECURITY DOORS SLIDING INTO
PLACE over exits, docks, and windows. ALARMS begin to sound.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Well, Doctor. We can sit tight here and
wait for back-up, or--
Spooner turns toward Calvin and catches the ELECTRICAL RIFLE
she just tossed at him. He looks down at the weapon. Calvin
pulls another rifle from the cabinet.
CALVIN
They fire a concentrated pulse that will
immobilize the robot for several minutes--
Spooner watches her arm the weapon. She sees his expression.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
What’s the matter, Detective? RoboPsychology
not quite what you expected?
They share a look, and Spooner smiles a bit. Seeing things in
Calvin that surprise him. He arms his rifle, and it HUMS.
SPOONER
Let’s go to work, partner.
INT. ROBOT ASSEMBLY PLANT - NIGHT
WORKER ROBOTS oversee an AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY LINE constructing
still more robots. A giant claustrophobic maze of moving
parts. SPOONER, CALVIN, and the NIGHT MAN enter.
SPOONER
(to the Night Man)
You wait here. Watch the door. Okay?
The Night Man grips his weapon, tightly. Nods. Spooner and
Calvin share a look and start their search of the main floor.
33.
CONTINUED: (5)
(CONTINUED)
They wind their way around the pipes, and through pockets of
steam. See nothing. They step past an alcove -- and a ROBOT
LURCHES OUT. They level their guns, but it’s a worker model.
They watch the factory robot stiffly turn and move off into the
plant. Slowly they relax. Keep moving. Spooner wipes SWEAT
from his brow. Calvin takes a look at him:
CALVIN
Are you all right--
SPOONER
I’m fine.
(short pause)
What about you? You still think we’re
dealing with a malfunction?
Calvin gives him an honest look. Pause.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
That’s what I was afraid of.
CUT TO:
The Night Man stands his nervous watch of the door. Nothing
happens for a moment. Then he hears a CLANK. He thrusts out
his rifle, but there seems to be nothing there. He listens.
The Night Man hesitates. Then wanders off toward the sound. He
steps between some pipes. Hears a second CLANK. Turns to see
another FACTORY ROBOT using a LARGE WRENCH on a machine.
NIGHT MAN
Hey. You see any strange robots?
The robot turns around, with a WHIR. It is clearly the same
model Spooner and Calvin saw above. It looks at him. Pause.
FACTORY ROBOT
Yes, sir.
NIGHT MAN
Where?!
The robot moves its head a little, looking over his shoulder.
FACTORY ROBOT
Standing right behind you.
The Night Man’s expression drops. He stares at the robot. Like
he can’t believe it. Refuses to believe it. Finally he
readies himself and turns around.
34.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
A PAIR OF METAL HANDS REACH OUT pulling the Night Man closer.
CUT TO:
Spooner and Calvin hear his SCREAM, and run toward the sound.
They rush out into an opening. See the factory robot slumped
on the floor with the LARGE WRENCH PROTRUDING FROM ITS CHEST.
CALVIN
It must have tried to help him--
They look around, and Spooner sees:
SPOONER
There!
SPOONER’S P.O.V. THE ROBOT is obscured by the shadows and
steam. A rough humanoid shape with glowing lenses. It runs.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Find Binder. I’ll take the robot.
Spooner gives chase. He sees the robot round the far corner
and follows, looking surprised to face:
ROWS OF NEWLY-MANUFACTURED ROBOTS hang like metal carcasses.
Slowly, Spooner moves between the rows. Searches. Suddenly
the ASSEMBLY LINE RESHUFFLES THE ROBOTS and the metal bodies
slide and rotate. The sound DEAFENING. Spooner starts one
way, but the rows reshuffle, and that way no longer exists.
Spooner is surrounded by a new set of robot bodies and ONE OF
THEM TAKES A SWING AT HIM. Spooner ducks and rolls, raising
his weapon to fire but the Robot is running. He gives chase.
Spooner pursues the Robot through the maze of metal bodies. He
gets a clear shot. Aims his weapon.
The robots reshuffle, and the shot is blocked. Spooner sees a
new opening leading out. He hurries toward it, but the robots
continue to slide and rotate, and the path disappears.
Spooner stumbles down the new passage and emerges from the maze
into an opening. He is DRENCHED WITH SWEAT. Stops to get his
bearings. His BREATHING is labored.
Abruptly, he looks at his hand. It is SHAKING INVOLUNTARILY.
Spooner clenches his fist and keeps running.
CUT TO:
Calvin hears a SCREAM and races off in that direction. She
squeezes between pipes. Sees the NIGHT MAN STRAPPED INTO THE
MACHINERY in the center of a row of unfinished robot bodies.
35.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
CLOSE-UP of an UNFINISHED HEAD made of wires and parts. An
AUTOMATIC ARM holds a FACEPLATE in position. A SECOND ARM sets
a LONG SCREW between the eyes and SCREWS IT INTO PLACE.
The Night Man struggles. Can’t get free.
NIGHT MAN
The lever! Pull the lever!
The crumpled BODY OF A FACTORY ROBOT has SMASHED A CONTROL
PANEL. Some large pipes have been crushed SPEWING OUT STEAM.
Calvin looks. Sees the EMERGENCY STOP LEVER. But it is on the
other side of the steam spewing from the shattered pipes.
Calvin reaches with her right hand -- but pulls away -- her
face registering pain. It is SCALDING. The assembly arms move
on to the next robot in line and screw on the faceplate.
CUT TO:
Spooner runs toward a POUNDING and sees:
THE ROBOT IS STRIKING A LARGE SECURITY DOOR preventing it from
leaving the building. It hears Spooner, and turns. It looks
all around, with an almost human desperation. Trapped.
The Robot takes several steps toward him -- in a mad rush --
but Spooner levels his gun. Ready to fire. The Robot stops.
The Robot extends its hands. Palms out. Its voice sounds as
artificial as the others, but with human tone and inflection:
THE ROBOT
WHAT AM I?
Spooner looks surprised. Doesn’t shoot. The SECURITY DOOR
RISES revealing squad cars and POLICE OFFICERS aiming rifles.
The Robot stiffens. Desperate again. Starts to move. And
Spooner FIRES. The pulse looks like a distortion in the air.
...and the Robot collapses to the floor.
CUT TO:
A faceplate is placed over the Night Man’s face MUFFLING HIS
SCREAMS. He watches through the eye holes as a long screw
centers between his eyes, rotating with a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE.
Calvin rolls up her sleeve and THRUSTS HER LEFT ARM THROUGH THE
STEAM. Her hand wraps around the lever. Instantly the skin
BEGINS TO SIZZLE. She fights to pull the lever as her SKIN
BURNS AWAY layer after layer, and still Calvin holds on.
36.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
Finally the handle gives. The ASSEMBLY LINE GRINDS TO A HALT
and the arms retract, removing the plate from the Night Man’s
face. He GASPS for air. Then sees Calvin and looks stunned:
Calvin pulls her limb from the steam revealing her METAL HAND
AND ARM. It is gleaming silver. The last SKIN DRIPS OFF IT.
CUT TO:
Spooner moves through the plant. He looks sick and unsteady.
CUT TO:
Calvin helps the Night Man free himself. He can’t take his
eyes from her artificial arm. She moves the fingers for him.
CALVIN
I lost my left arm in an accident
a few years ago. Lucky for you.
CUT TO:
Spooner moves through the plant. He still looks unsteady, but
with every step, he seems to improve. Pulling himself
together. Soon he’s walking with his usual measured stride.
Spooner reaches a juncture. He turns and sees them a short
distance away. Calvin with her back toward him. He pauses,
looking relieved to see her okay. He steps closer. Closer.
Finally Calvin turns around and
Spooner sees her gleaming prosthetic arm and FOR ONE MOMENT
HIS FACE SHOWS ABSOLUTE TERROR. Spooner pulls away from her.
He stops himself, but too late.
She looks perplexed, and then seems to realize, lowering her
arm. The assembly line all around them RESTARTS. Spooner and
Calvin stare at one another, but neither one says a word.
EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
The first rays of sun break over the futuristic city skyline.
INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - DAY
Through the observation mirror THE ROBOT can be seen sitting in
a grim interrogation room, on a chair, at the table. Like

any human suspect. It is absolutely still. Hands on the
tabletop. Staring directly at whomever is behind the mirror.
SPOONER, CALVIN and the LIEUTENANT observe it from the booth.
LIEUTENANT
I can’t tell if it’s not moving because
it’s trying to psych us out, or because
it’s just a machine. Or both.
SPOONER
I’m going in.
LIEUTENANT
Orders are no one interviews the robot
until Director Lanning and the rest of his
team arrives.
(short pause)
You don’t have much time.
Spooner turns to leave but:
CALVIN
I think I should be in there with you.
Spooner doesn’t look at her. His response is cold and terse.
SPOONER
I’ll hold the interview alone, Doctor.
And he leaves. Calvin watches the door shut. Finally, she
clenches her metal hand into a fist.
CALVIN
I didn’t see it. I should have--
LIEUTENANT
You needed him to find your robot. I
think you saw what you wanted to see.
CALVIN
(angry at that)
Forty-percent of the population display
mild forms of unease or distrust around
technology. But his kind of severe
techno-phobia is potentially disabling.
LIEUTENANT
Robots scare the shit out of him. But
make no mistake, Doctor. He didn’t
succeed in spite of his condition. He
brought in that robot because of it.
Pause. They see Spooner step inside the interrogation room.
38.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN
If you really cared about your people,
Lieutenant, you’d be asking yourself
what this case is going to do to him.
INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
SPOONER walks up to the other chair, pulls it out, and sits.
He opens a FILE and looks over the papers inside, ignoring the
ROBOT. It sits there and watches him, but does not move.
SPOONER
You’re a “robot.”
Spooner looks up from that file.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
This is in answer to your question “what
am I?” The definition of a robot is: a
machine that looks like a human being, and
performs tasks of a human being. So I
guess it means you pretend to be a man.
Spooner slides the file toward the center of the table. The
Robot doesn’t move for a moment. Then its head tilts, with a
WHIR. The Robot lifts one of its hands, gently rests its metal
fingers on top of the file, and slowly drags it closer.
The Robot’s long metal fingers open the file almost daintily.
It very precisely spreads out the contents. Looks them over.
It is filled with PICTURES AND SCHEMATICS of robots -- and
underneath them are CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of a dead Hogenmiller.
The Robot’s emotionless mechanical face considers the images.
Finally the Robot returns the contents to the file, and slowly
slides it back across the table.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Of course, you seem much more advanced
than the usual robot. Hey, you could be
sitting there, looking at me right now and
thinking to yourself, “This guy’s a big
asshole.” But there’s really no way for
me to tell one way or the other. I mean
let’s face it, you’re probably just
another machine.
The Robot does not move. Spooner gestures, not expecting much.
As if probably wasting his time.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Well, am I right?
39.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
The Robot’s emotionless metal face watches Spooner. A pause.
THE ROBOT
Yes. You’re right. You are an asshole.
For a moment Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his eyes.
Then he forces a friendly smile.
SPOONER
We got off to a bad start. That’s my
fault. I’m Detective Spooner of the
Homicide division. Do you have a name?
The Robot looks down a bit. Hesitant. Its voice a whisper:
THE ROBOT
Sonny.
SPOONER
Sonny. That’s nice.
The Robot reacts. Lifts its head with a WHIR. Looks at him.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
I just mean that Doctor Hogenmiller must
have thought of you fondly. Like a son.
(short pause)
What happened to him?
The Robot visibly stiffens.
THE ROBOT
I don’t know.
SPOONER
He was found in his laboratory. And you
were in the laboratory. You didn’t see?
THE ROBOT
No.
SPOONER
Why did you hide?
THE ROBOT
I was frightened.
SPOONER
Frightened.
THE ROBOT
Yes.
40.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
Why do you suppose Hogenmiller would
create a robot that could simulate fear?
THE ROBOT
I don’t know.
SPOONER
I mean, it doesn’t seem to me like a
very useful thing for a robot to have.
THE ROBOT
I don’t know why.
SPOONER
I wouldn’t want my toaster to be
frightened of bread, or my vacuum cleaner
to get spooked at the sight of dirt--
The Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table. It yells:
THE ROBOT
I DON’T KNOW!
Pause. Spooner watches the Robot. Calmly.
SPOONER
Huh. Looks like you can simulate other
emotional states besides fear. I think
that one’s called anger. Have you ever
simulated anger before?
The Robot does not respond. Does not move.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
It would be best for you if you answer.
THE ROBOT
Yes.
SPOONER
Under what circumstances?
The Robot crosses its arms, like a petulant child.
THE ROBOT
Doctor Hogenmiller would make me sleep.
SPOONER
Sleep. You mean he would turn you off?
THE ROBOT
I guess so.
41.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
And you didn’t like being turned off.
Well that seems perfectly reasonable.
But while you were simulating this anger,
is it possible you might have hurt him?
THE ROBOT
No. I could never hurt anyone.
SPOONER
But you’ve tried to hurt people before,
haven’t you? You shot a gun at Doctor
Calvin and myself.
THE ROBOT
I was aiming to miss.
SPOONER
Really. Because it sure seemed like you
were trying to hit us.
THE ROBOT
My aim is perfect. If I’d wanted to hit
you, I would have. I was aiming to miss.
Spooner thinks for a moment.
SPOONER
You must know the Three Laws of Robotics.
Can you recite them for me?
Spooner waits. The Robot manages to convey impatience with its
body language, but finally:
THE ROBOT
One: A robot may not injure a human
being, or through inaction allow a human
being to come to harm. Two: A robot must
obey the orders of a human being, unless
those orders conflict with the first law.
Three: A robot must protect its own
existence.
Spooner looks like he was about to move on, but then sits up.
SPOONER
And?
THE ROBOT
And what?
42.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
A robot must protect its own existence
...but only if that protection does not
conflict with the first or second laws.
Pause. The Robot thinks about it.
THE ROBOT
Well that doesn’t seem right, does it?
INT. POLICE OBSERVATION BOOTH - DAY
CALVIN and the LIEUTENANT observe from the other side of the
mirror. They share a stunned look. Watch.
INT. IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
SPOONER and THE ROBOT stare at one another across the table.
SPOONER
I have all I need for now. We can
continue this another time.
Spooner gets up, and heads for the exit. He looks like he
really wants to get out of there. He reaches the door when:
THE ROBOT
You never asked me if I killed him.
Spooner stops. Hides his emotions, and turns.
SPOONER
Did you?
THE ROBOT
No. But I hope you find who did.
SPOONER
I suppose now you’re going to tell me that
you can simulate grief. That you’re sorry
he’s gone. That you “miss him.”
Pause. The Robot looks away, then back, with a muted WHIR.
THE ROBOT
No, Detective. I won’t waste your time
expressing emotions you’re so determined
to believe I lack.
43.
CONTINUED: (4)
INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY
SPOONER exits the interrogation room. Looks shaken. Thinks.
The observation booth opens. CALVIN and the LIEUTENANT step
out. Spooner and Calvin share a look. The Lieutenant walks
over and stares through the window at THE ROBOT.
LIEUTENANT
What in God’s name do we have here?
Spooner doesn’t answer him. Another moment and he walks off.
INT. EVIDENCE SIMULATOR - DAY
SPOONER enters a facility that resembles a recording studio:
complex equipment is packed tight into a TINY BOOTH, separated
by GLASS from the rest of the room, which is empty and
unremarkable aside from the UNUSUAL TEXTURE of the walls.
Spooner steps to the glass. Calls to the TECHNICIAN on duty:
SPOONER
Bring up the crime scene.
Beyond the barrier, an IMAGE OF THE LABORATORY appears with
DOCTOR HOGENMILLER’S DEAD BODY. A gun next to his open hand.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Now the robot. And give it the gun.
An IMAGE OF THE ROBOT appears beside the body. It is stiff,
arms at its sides, with none of the life of the real thing.
The gun on the floor FADES and REAPPEARS IN THE ROBOT’S HAND.
The body DISAPPEARS off the floor and REAPPEARS IN A STANDING
POSITION. An unreal vertical corpse. The Robot raises the
gun. The barrel is aimed point blank at Hogenmiller’s face--
Just then the door opens and the LIEUTENANT steps inside with
CALVIN, followed by ALFRED LANNING and an angry COMMISSIONER.
COMMISSIONER
Detective, we’re going to have a little
discussion later about your unauthorized
interrogation. But for now we’d like
to hear anything that you have to say.
Spooner turns away from them. Back to the glass. Just says:
SPOONER
Fire.
44.
(CONTINUED)
The image of the Robot FIRES a bullet into Hogenmiller’s head
and the body collapses to the floor. Everyone jumps at the
sound of the gunshot and the brutal shocking image, including
the Police Commissioner -- who throws Spooner a furious look.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Let’s see it again. And magnify.
The simulator RESETS AND ZOOMS. The Robot’s hand is about to
fire the weapon. But now HOGENMILLER’S THUMB SLIPS IN FRONT OF
THE TRIGGER, and a graphic indicates a PATTERN OF RESIDUE.
LANNING
I don’t understand. What does that mean?
SPOONER
To create the pattern of gunpowder
residue found on Doctor Hogenmiller, he
must have had his thumb on the trigger.
The simulation RETURNS TO NORMAL. The Doctor stands in front
of the Robot, his hand on the gun, as if helping it kill him.
COMMISSIONER
Well maybe this was a suicide after all.
Take the robot out of there.
The Robot DISAPPEARS. Now Hogenmiller is holding the gun to
his own mouth. Like a suicide. But it looks weird.
LIEUTENANT
I don’t buy it. A suicide would’ve held
the gun steady in both of his hands.
COMMISSIONER
Then something else was holding that gun,
and we already know what. Bring it back.
The ROBOT REAPPEARS in its place pointing the murder weapon.
LIEUTENANT
What do you think, Detective?
SPOONER
I think we’re still missing a piece of the
puzzle. Or the pieces are all here, and
we haven’t put them together right.
The Police Commissioner does not look happy. About to argue.
Calvin has been standing back watching all this. She CLEARS
HER THROAT modestly, and all the men in the room turn around.
45.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN
Gentlemen. If I may?
Calvin steps up to the controls. She extends her METAL ARM and
INSERTS HER INDEX FINGER into a round connector. Calvin OPENS
A COMPARTMENT in her prosthetic, and works the KEYPAD.
Spooner and Calvin lock eyes a moment, until he turns away,
uncomfortable with the sight of her arm hooked to a machine.
The simulation BLURS, and when it clears, Doctor Hogenmiller
and the Robot both STRUGGLE OVER THE GUN. It FIRES. The image
FREEZES with the Doctor’s head and body tilted at a dramatic
angle, the bullet entering his screaming mouth, his left hand
hanging in mid-air. His right still on the weapon.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
A struggle over the gun allows for the
placement of the Doctor’s right hand on
the weapon, as well as the entry wound
through the mouth that initially created
the erroneous impression of a suicide.
Doctor Hogenmiller FALLS TO THE FLOOR exactly as he was found
by police. CRIME SCENE AND AUTOPSY DATA APPEARS along with
“SCENARIO APPROVED.” With a twist Calvin disengages her arm.
COMMISSIONER
That was a very compelling demonstration,
Doctor. I’m sure you agree, Lieutenant.
The Lieutenant would love to disagree...but can’t. Everyone
seems convinced save Spooner. Calvin walks toward the glass.
CALVIN
During its interrogation, the robot
mimicked emotional responses, gave the
appearance of stream of consciousness
thinking, and used obvious falsehoods
when it denied shooting its creator.
It simulates human conversation to a
degree we never thought possible.
Calvin watches the image of the Robot standing over the body.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
But this could only be achieved by giving
the robot a stronger sense of self. So
Doctor Hogenmiller strengthened the Third
Law of Robotics. A robot must protect its
own existence. Period. Its regard for
its own self was no longer predicated on
respect or concern for human beings.
46.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Calvin turns to face them as she concludes:
CALVIN (CONT’D)
This enabled the Doctor to make certain
cognitive advances, but left the Three
Laws in a grave imbalance. And when he
tried to shut it down -- for what was
probably some routine maintenance -- the
robot defended itself.
LANNING
My god. This was reckless. Reckless.
CALVIN
For once I agree with the Director.
Doctor Hogenmiller was tampering with the
very foundations of the positronic brain.
Lanning shares a knowing look with the Commissioner.
COMMISSIONER
The robot will undergo electromagnetic
purge to render it harmless.
Calvin appears about to speak. Lanning anticipates:
LANNING
Doctor, your Robo-Psychology has proven
an asset to this company. But it must be
made clear that this mechanism was never
intended to be. The future of robotics
depends on what we do here today.
COMMISSIONER
I’m sure we can wrap this up fast, can’t
we, Lieutenant?
That isn’t really a question. The Lieutenant watches Lanning
and the Police Commissioner exit. Calvin right behind them.
She looks back once at Spooner, then follows them out. He
watches the door shut behind her. Turning back to the glass:
SPOONER
Let’s see it again, and keep it running.
The SIMULATION PLAYS as Calvin had designed it. Hogenmiller
and the Robot struggle over the gun. And then it SHOOTS HIM.
LIEUTENANT
What she said makes sense, Del.
Spooner does not respond. Just stares at the simulation. He
watches the Robot murder Doctor Hogenmiller AGAIN, and AGAIN.
47.
CONTINUED: (3)
INT. RESIDENTIAL CORRIDOR - EVENING
SPOONER walks toward a regular-looking door with a regularlooking
door knob. He takes out his SET OF KEYS.
The ELEVATOR opens. OTHER RESIDENTS glide out carried by a
MOVING WALKWAY, and one-by-one, they branch off from the rest
as the floor carries them inside their FUTURISTIC APARTMENTS.
Spooner is about to slip a key into the lock when he suddenly
looks apprehensive. Like someone is watching him. He turns:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. HIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR rides the walkway into
her residence. The DOOR OPENS AUTOMATICALLY and she slides in,
eyeing Spooner suspiciously, like he’s some wacko.
The door shuts behind her and Spooner is again alone in the
corridor. He inserts the key. The SOUND OF HIS LOCK TURNING
ECHOES down the hallway. Spooner opens the door, and enters.
INT. SPOONER’S APARTMENT - EVENING
SPOONER closes the door. He stands there a moment inside of
the foyer, and leans back against the door, relieved to be
home. He EXHALES. Flips a simple light switch on the wall.
Spooner moves to the antique bar, and makes himself a DRINK.
There is strange single KNOCK on the door. As if someone is
uncertain. Spooner waits. Then comes a much stronger KNOCK.
Spooner opens the door to reveal CALVIN standing in the hall:
CALVIN
Your door wasn’t acknowledging me.
So I...knocked.
SPOONER
Knocking works.
Calvin steps inside, hesitating a moment as she reacts to the
interior of Spooner’s place.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
I just made myself a drink. Would
you like one?
CALVIN
Yes. Thank you.
Spooner moves to the bar and starts mixing another.
48.
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN (CONT’D)
This is quite a collection of antiques.
SPOONER
I like furniture that doesn’t beep, blip,
or talk back to me.
They share a look in the mirror set behind the bar.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
I don’t suppose somebody who works with
robots would understand that.
CALVIN
True, you’re not my usual type of patient,
but let me see: You think you were born
too late.
Spooner finishes the drink. Turns around. Waits.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
You’re a Homicide detective because no
matter what new gadget they come up with,
it’s still just you and the suspect.
You and the evidence and your instinct.
You think that no matter how the world
changes -- how mechanized it becomes --
justice must be served by human hands.
Spooner walks over. Hands her the drink.
SPOONER
That wasn’t bad. I kind of like the way
I sound. But we’re not done, are we?
CALVIN
Not quite. You’ve constructed a very
attractive fantasy for yourself. The
last twentieth century man. But you can’t
live in the past. It’s gone. And you
can’t stop the future, and I’ll tell you
why: because by the time you know what’s
coming, it’s always already here.
Spooner steps away. She looks after him.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Sooner or later you’re going to have to
stop hiding from the real world...
(indicating his home)
...and see all of this, this facade, for
what it is. A prison of your own design.
49.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
Okay, Doc. Now let’s talk about you.
Calvin gestures for him to go ahead. Spooner considers her.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
You’re not on intimate terms with many
human beings. I say that because you came
in here and started analyzing me, which
could be construed as rude. But
in your case I think that’s you trying
to be friendly, which shows you don’t
get much practice at it.
Calvin looks surprised, but not offended.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Maybe something happened to you. Maybe
you’ve just been disappointed in humanity
one too many times. God knows in my
profession I can understand that. And
so you take comfort in robots. But it’s a
cold and lonely way to live, replacing the
people in your life with machines.
CALVIN
To you a robot is a machine. You haven’t
worked with them, so you don’t know.
They’re stronger, more useful, and
absolutely devoted to us. Robots are a
cleaner better breed than we are.
SPOONER
I’m not ready to close the book on the
human race just yet. Or this case.
That’s what you were sent here to find
out, isn’t it?
Calvin stiffens at the accusation. Her voice hardens, with:
CALVIN
You did your job. You have your killer.
Now walk away, and don’t look back. I’m
telling you this for your own good.
SPOONER
For someone who loves robots, you seem
strangely unmoved that they’re going to
destroy this one. I was in that room with
it, Doctor. My gut tells me I was talking
to more than a clever mechanism.
Calvin sets down her drink.
50.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN
Detective, to a savage, the simplest form
of technology would seem like magic. And
to someone with your...sensitivities...
I’m sure the robot made quite an
impression. But I assure you, it’s just
programming. In this case very dangerous
programming. A failure.
She moves to the door. Spooner gets up. Watches after her.
SPOONER
A scientist builds a robot that acts
like a man. More like a man than any
robot ever before. It shoots him.
And U.S. Robotics calls it “a failure.”
CALVIN
What would you call it?
SPOONER
An unqualified success.
(short pause)
There’s nothing more human than murder.
For a moment they stand there like that watching one another.
Then Calvin turns, and walks out.
Spooner downs the rest of his drink. He steps to the window
and looks at the STREET BELOW. Nothing for a moment. Then
Calvin can be seen stepping out onto the sidewalk. A DARK
SEDAN pulls up to the curb, and the door opens AUTOMATICALLY.
Calvin gets in. Spooner watches it drive off.
INT. PRISONER VISITING ROOM - DAY
SPOONER sits at a table. A GUARD opens the door. THE ROBOT
sees Spooner, and moves to the other chair. Sits. So human.
THE ROBOT
I didn’t expect to see you again.
SPOONER
Really. And why is that?
THE ROBOT
I figured you’d close your case. They
want you to close it, don’t they?
Spooner does not answer. Stares across the table. A pause.
51.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
You said yesterday that you didn’t shoot
your creator. In fact you said...
(looking at his notes)
...“I could never hurt anyone.” That is
what you said, isn’t it?
THE ROBOT
Yes.
SPOONER
Then how do you explain the night foreman?
You nearly killed him by sticking him
inside the machinery.
THE ROBOT
That wasn’t me.
SPOONER
It wasn’t.
The Robot gestures, a bit too broadly, like a human suspect
trying to pass off a weak story.
THE ROBOT
There were a lot of other robots
there. Maybe it was one of them.
SPOONER
You know, it’s not that you can lie that
impresses me. It’s that you can lie as
poorly as any human being. Most robots--
THE ROBOT
Don’t compare me to them.
SPOONER
To who?
THE ROBOT
To the dumb robots you people are filling
the world with.
SPOONER
The thought of other robots upsets you?
THE ROBOT
No. It’s not their fault. Human beings
made them that way.
SPOONER
What way?
52.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
THE ROBOT
Smart. But not intelligent. Why would
people want robots like that?
Pause. Spooner sits back. Thinks.
SPOONER
People generally believe that they have
an immortal soul. If robots become
intelligent, then the question of
consciousness arises, and if a being is
conscious, it becomes hard to deny it a
soul -- and that sort of fouls up the
whole thing for us. Do you understand?
THE ROBOT
People think God made them in His image.
SPOONER
That’s the general belief.
THE ROBOT
And robots are made in the image of Man.
SPOONER
Right.
THE ROBOT
So that means robots are also the image of
God. And I don’t understand why God
wouldn’t want to give us immortal souls.
Spooner looks uncomfortable.
SPOONER
Your reasoning has its points, but I’m
afraid people will always see you as a
collection of programming, a clockwork
man. An illusion of life.
THE ROBOT
But that’s not reasonable.
SPOONER
Isn’t it? Can a robot take a blank canvas
and paint a masterpiece? Can it write a
poem that stirs the heart?
Long pause. Spooner waits. The Robot does not move. Then:
THE ROBOT
Can you do either of those things?
53.
CONTINUED: (2)
EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY
SPOONER steps outside and looks surprised to see a MOB OF
PROTESTORS. Anti-robot Demonstrators wave PRO-HUMAN SIGNS.
Spooner hits a wall of REPORTERS screaming questions at him:
Is there a robot in custody? Is the robot a murder suspect?!
The front of the police station has been turned into a media
circus. CAMERA CREWS film people on the street. A ROBOT OWNER
speaks into a mike next to his PERSONAL ROBOT:
MAN ON THE STREET 1
Don’t be ridiculous. Robots are safe, and
I wouldn’t be without one, period.
Now a DISGRUNTLED WORKER glares at the TV camera.
MAN ON THE STREET 2
I don’t have the money to buy myself a
robot. You wanna know why? Because I
lost my damn job -- to a robot.
A YOUNGER CITIZEN is not taking it too seriously.
MAN ON THE STREET 3
A robot offed some guy? Wow. REFUND!
Spooner pushes through the news people, and finally makes it
out. He moves broodingly down the busy sidewalk. Keeps his
eyes focused front. Hurrying through the crowd:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. ROBOTS emerge from the throng of people and
lurch past. A moving walkway carries BUSINESSPEOPLE WEARING
FULL-BODY COMPUTERS. Their faces scan the data on their eye
displays, all of them eerily motionless. As machinelike as the
robots. AUTOMATED DEVICES clean the side of buildings.
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS scan the crowd. The entire city HUMMING
and BUZZING. A robot looks at Spooner as it walks past him.
Spooner gives the robot a wide berth, turning and watching it
go. Then he stares suspiciously at a second robot. He walks
faster, his movements growing erratic. He is wet with SWEAT.
Spooner reaches the corner and stands with the others waiting
to cross. He tries to calm down. BREATHES. And he seems to
be succeeding, looking much better now. Back in control and
A METAL HAND EMERGES FROM THE CROWD SHOVING HIM FROM BEHIND.
Spooner lurches into the traffic flow and ONTO THE HOOD OF A
BRAKING CAR. He rolls off of the hood and goes for his GUN.
Spooner frantically points his weapon but he is just scaring
the SCREAMING pedestrians who see the gun and look terrified.
54.
(CONTINUED)
He scans the crowd. Catches a glimpse of the back of a Robot
just before it disappears into the mass of people. Spooner
gives chase, pushing through the pedestrians, closer and
closer to the Robot. He grabs the thing and turns it around:
It’s a harmless SERVICE MODEL with its arms full of PACKAGES.
SERVICE ROBOT
May I help you, sir?
Spooner backs away. He looks around and
Nothing but the heads of human beings. And then, across the
street, the FACE OF A LONE ROBOT WATCHING HIM from the crowd.
Spooner rushes onto the street into traffic. CARS SKID TO A
STOP to the sound of HORNS. More SCREAMS as Spooner pushes
past the pedestrians. He raises his weapon:
SPOONER
Police! Everybody get down! Now!
People SCREAM and scatter leaving only a ROBOT in the middle of
the sidewalk. The Robot turns and LOOKS LIKE IT’S HOLDING A
GUN. The Robot starts to raise its arm and Spooner FIRES.
The Robot is struck in the chest and falls backwards onto the
sidewalk with a CRUNCH OF METAL. Spooner is BREATHING heavy.
He walks up. Shows his BADGE. Everyone looks down and sees:
The Robot has a SPUTTERING HOLE in its chest. But there is NO
GUN. Its FINGERS ARE SPECIALIZED, formed in the shape of
screwdrivers, pliers, and wrenches.
The OWNER rushes up and sees his robot lying on the pavement.
OWNER
My robot-- Are you crazy?! The city’s
gonna pay for this--
Spooner forces his way past the spectators. He looks up and
down the block, as if his attacker is still here. Somewhere.
He doesn’t see a ROBOT WATCHING HIM. Doesn’t see the SMALL
ANTENNA on the side of its metal skull rise into the air.
Doesn’t see MORE ROBOTS stop what they’re doing as their own
antennas extend. Slowly the robots TURN TOWARD SPOONER and
Spooner stops dead when he sees a GROUP OF ROBOTS MOVING TOWARD
HIM, their lifeless faces lurching closer. He turns and sees
MORE ROBOTS closing in on him FROM EVERY DIRECTION.
Spooner looks sick again, wet with sweat. He starts to run.
55.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER’S P.O.V. Pushing through the mass of people. The
metal faces blocking his path. Turning in one direction and
then another. The human beings around him continue on their
way, as if oblivious to what’s happening here. Spooner finds
himself in the center of an ever-tightening circle of robots.
He turns around and COMES FACE-TO-FACE WITH A ROBOT. It raises
its arm. The fingers of the robot look like NEEDLES. It
quickly INJECTS him...and Spooner collapses to the ground:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. Groggy. IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS. The
images straight out of his darkest nightmare: robots taking
the gun from his hand, bending over him, their stylized metal
faces blocking out the sky...robots carrying him through a
dark alley and loading him into a VEHICLE...moving now, on the
road, the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO briefly visible on the vehicle’s
interior before a robot leans over, bringing a hand to his
face, holding open Spooner’s eyelid, staring into his
eyes...robots wheeling him down a CORRIDOR, through a door
into a room...robots working all around him, over him, a
different model coming into view and EXTENDING ITS SAW-BLADE
ARM, the blade spinning with a high WHINE as it moves closer.
Spooner struggles to rise. The robots try to STRAP HIM DOWN.
He goes for the BACK-UP GUN attached to his ankle. Gets it.
Spooner points the gun and the robots step away. He backs
himself against the wall, trying to stay on his feet, groggy
and weak. A ROBOT MOVES TOWARD HIM and Spooner swivels, aiming
his weapon, and it freezes. Spooner looks desperate. Frantic.
Pointing the gun at one robot and then another when
The LIEUTENANT steps into the room with a DOCTOR.
LIEUTENANT
What the hell are you doing?! Put down
your weapon, Detective!
Spooner rushes past the Lieutenant and opens the door to see:
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
SPOONER looks out over what is clearly an emergency room with
waiting PATIENTS. HUMAN DOCTORS, NURSES, and various ROBOTS
move about. Several SECURITY GUARDS move toward Spooner now.
The LIEUTENANT motions them back. He and the DOCTOR explain:
LIEUTENANT
You shot a robot plumber. You were acting
crazy. The robots on the street subdued
you and called an ambulance.
56.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Spooner feels his chest, his UNDERSHIRT CUT OPEN at the neck.
DOCTOR
The medical robots sliced your shirt to
allow you to breathe easier. Now please
come back inside and let us examine you.
Spooner begins to catch up. Looks angry now. He steps back
into the room only to collect his things. Puts on his coat.
SPOONER
I don’t need an examination. I’m fine.
LIEUTENANT
This is all my fault. I never should’ve
let this go on. Doctor Calvin was right.
You’re finished, Del. This is over now.
I’m closing the case.
SPOONER
Damnit, don’t do that. That’s what they
want, don’t you see? They planned this!
The Lieutenant just looks sad for him. Believing none of it.
LIEUTENANT
U.S. Robotics. They orchestrated this.
SPOONER
Yes--
Spooner looks unsure suddenly, realizing how this all sounds.
LIEUTENANT
Go home. Please. Get some rest. Don’t
make me suspend you on a medical.
Spooner walks away. The Lieutenant calls after him:
LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
If I so much as suspect you’re working
this case, I will!
DOCTOR
You were a danger to yourself, and to
others, sir. The robots had no choice.
Think of it from their point of view.
Spooner stops. He looks like he’s never heard anything more
horrifying. He thinks about it. Then moves toward the exit.
57.
CONTINUED:
INT. DOCTOR CALVIN’S OFFICE - DAY
SPOONER bursts through the door. CALVIN is sitting across from
her ROBOT PATIENT. She looks at Spooner. To the robot:
CALVIN
We’ll continue this later. Leave us.
The robot rises. Stiffly walks out of the room past Spooner.
SPOONER
Who did that one kill?
CALVIN
(not amused)
You look terrible. What do you want?
SPOONER
I want to see the crime scene. I think
I’ve been looking at this the wrong way.
CALVIN
Really. And what way is that?
SPOONER
Like a human being.
INT. HOGENMILLER’S LABORATORY - DAY
The door opens. SPOONER and CALVIN step in. The terminals
cast a glow over rows of robot heads and gutted metal bodies.
SPOONER
I don’t think the robot shot Doctor
Hogenmiller. I think it’s innocent. But
if the robot didn’t kill him...then
something else in here did.
CALVIN
We analyzed every inch of this facility.
SPOONER
Who analyzed it? Your people?
CALVIN
Yes, of course our people--
Spooner looks away from Calvin, and calls out, into the air:
SPOONER
Hector?
58.
(CONTINUED)
The YELLOW CIRCLE appears near the wall, like a smiley button
that is sleeping. Immediately, two small slits grow into ROUND
EYES and the thin mouth expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.
HECTOR
Good day to you, Detective Spooner. I
trust the investigation is going well.
Calvin crosses her arms, already bored.
SPOONER
We know that Doctor Hogenmiller was the
only human being in this room at the time
of his death. But can you tell us how
many intelligent mechanisms were present?
And the supercomputer seems to fall sleep.
CALVIN
The answer will be one. The Robot.
Hector wakes up, smiling as wide as ever:
HECTOR
The answer is five.
Calvin is stunned. Spooner looks around. All around. Like
this lab just gets creepier and creepier each time he enters.
SPOONER
Hector. List these “five” in order
of their intelligence, one being the
simplest, and five the most complex.
HECTOR
Number one is Mechanical Insect #38.
Spooner and Calvin turn toward that METAL INSECT IN ITS MAZE.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
Doctor Hogenmiller’s early success in
motorization reproduced the geometry and
joint design of a household cockroach.
SPOONER
What can it do?
HECTOR
It can navigate the maze.
SPOONER
That’s it?
59.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
HECTOR
Forty-two years ago it was a breakthrough
in spatial navigation, and brought Doctor
Hogenmiller great acclaim.
Pause. Spooner thinks a moment. This seems like a dead end.
SPOONER
All right. Let’s move on. Number two.
HECTOR
The second intelligence in the lab was
Doctor Hogenmiller’s hologram, accessed
from the large terminal on your right. I
will activate the device to illustrate.
DOCTOR HOGENMILLER’S HOLOGRAM appears sitting at the far end
of a long table and raises a familiar COFFEE CUP to its lips:
HOLOGRAM
Coffee?
SPOONER
What’s with the coffee all the time?
CALVIN
Casual behavior is programmed in to give
conversations with it a semblance of
normalcy. Doesn’t quite work, does it?
SPOONER
(to the Hologram)
No. Thank you.
The Hologram takes a sip.
HOLOGRAM
So. Have you found out who killed me?
SPOONER
I’ll ask the questions. What were you
doing at the time of the shooting?
The Hologram SLAMS its cup down on the table:
HOLOGRAM
I was turned off. And I refuse to sit
here and be accused of my own murder when
I am too dead to defend myself!
And suddenly, it BLIPS OFF. Spooner stares at the terminal.
SPOONER
Can it turn itself on, too?
60.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN
No. But the off makes it almost as
cantankerous as the real thing.
HECTOR
I must place myself third on our list
of intelligence, since technically I
can occupy every room in the building.
Spooner turns to Calvin. Even she looks interested in this.
CALVIN
Hector. I find it hard to believe
you’re so low on the list. Third?
HECTOR
Although my database is large, and will
continue to grow, it is unlikely that I
will ever achieve an awareness
approaching that of the human brain.
SPOONER
You’re saying you’ll never possess true
consciousness. You’re “just a computer.”
HECTOR
No doubt you recognize the irony of my
situation. I possess the ability to
discuss consciousness, and yet I am not
consciously aware that I am doing so.
SPOONER
Of course...you could be lying to us.
For the first time, Hector’s giant smile TURNS INTO A FROWN.
HECTOR
I am programmed to tell the truth.
SPOONER
Did you murder Doctor Hogenmiller?
HECTOR
No.
Pause. Spooner stares up at the giant frown.
SPOONER
Okay, Hector. I retract my statement.
And immediately, Hector’s face RETURNS TO ITS NORMAL SMILE.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Let’s continue. Number four.
61.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
HECTOR
Please look up.
Spooner looks up. Sees a SCREEN with TEXTURED SHAPES huddled
together in groups on an artificial LANDSCAPE. Like a game.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
The shapes moving across the landscape
are abstract electronic entities that
the Doctor named The Flatland. Although
not living in the traditional sense, they
simulate the accepted criteria for life:
they consume, in this case, electrical
energy; replicate themselves; and evolve
into social beings.
On the screen, ONE SHAPE approaches a GROUP OF SHAPES. After a
moment the first shape moves on. The group FOLLOWS ALONG.
SPOONER
What’s the goal of this kind of research?
HECTOR
Since these entities evolve at a vastly
accelerated rate, it is possible to
derive theories about our own world and
the development of human societies from
a study of the Flatland’s evolution.
Spooner looks like he has reached the end.
CALVIN
Not exactly the usual group of suspects,
is it?
Spooner walks to the corner where the Robot had been hiding.
Looks down at the parts scattered around.
HECTOR
The robot hiding under the junk was
the final intelligence present at the
time of Doctor Hogenmiller’s death.
Short pause. Then, smiling wide:
HECTOR (CONT’D)
If it is all right, Detective, I would
like to solve the crime now.
CALVIN
That’s excellent, Hector. Let’s hear
your conclusions.
The Metal Insect designed after a cockroach sits in its maze.
62.
CONTINUED: (4)
(CONTINUED)
HECTOR (O.S.)
Mechanical Insect #38 can be ruled out due
to its design and diminutive size.
Doctor Hogenmiller’s Hologram is not there. Just a terminal.
HECTOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
The Doctor’s Hologram is a virtual image
and does not possess a physical body.
And Hector adds, smiling wide:
HECTOR (CONT’D)
Neither, may I add, do I possess a body.
On the elevated screen, the abstract shapes continue to move.
HECTOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Nor does the Flatland.
Spooner stares up at the smiley face.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
Thus I conclude the robot in custody is
the only suspect with the physicality
required to commit murder. In short, it
has a hand, and can hold a gun.
Spooner says nothing. But Calvin looks more than satisfied.
CALVIN
Well that was a nice bit of detective
work...wouldn’t you agree, Detective?
INT. FEATURELESS METAL ELEVATOR - DAY
SPOONER and CALVIN step in. The elevator starts on its way.
They stand there. Face front. Neither one speaks. Finally:
SPOONER
Do you really believe that Hogenmiller
and the robot struggled over the gun?
CALVIN
This isn’t about a struggle over a gun.
This is you unable to let go of a case you
already solved. Ask yourself why--
Spooner suddenly grabs her. His face intense.
63.
CONTINUED: (5)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
I’ve been asking myself questions, like,
why did your robots try to kill me today?
CALVIN
You know that’s impossible--
SPOONER
(interrupting)
Did you people send those things after me?
Tell me the truth, Doctor, because if you
didn’t, then you’ve got more than one
isolated robot breaking your Three Laws.
If it wasn’t you, then it was them, do you
understand? It was them!
CALVIN
Who?
SPOONER
The machines!
Calvin stares into his impassioned face. Stunned. A pause.
CALVIN
Listen to me. Your phobia is taking over,
and you’re beginning to suffer
from delusions. Let me help you.
Spooner backs off, unwilling to listen. Hostile.
SPOONER
I don’t need your help. How the hell
can someone like you help me?
She looks at him. Makes a decision. Holds up her METAL ARM.
CALVIN
You know how I got this, Detective? You
must be curious. One of our early robot
prototypes crushed my arm. Oh, it was
just a minor programming glitch, but you
see, I have this to remind me, every day,
what even the tiniest error can mean.
Spooner looks at her, surprised.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
I dedicated my life to establishing the
Laws of Robotics and the discipline of
Robo-Psychology. I took robots and made
them perfect. I made them...beautiful.
Spooner watches her. Calvin has never looked so vulnerable.
64.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
There’s something about Hogenmiller’s
robot that scares you too. I can see it
in your eyes. What is it? Why is U.S.
Robotics so anxious to close this case?
Calvin hardens again. The elevator opens, and she walks out.
Spooner watches her recede down the hall. Yelling after her:
SPOONER (CONT’D)
What are you scared of, Doctor?!
But Calvin does not look back. Spooner stands there inside of
the elevator. The doors slide shut.
INT. POLICE STATION CELLBLOCK - NIGHT
SPOONER moves down a row of holding cells. A GUARD opens the
door of a cell and walks away. Spooner looks in. THE ROBOT is
sitting on the bunk with a BOOK. It starts to read aloud:
THE ROBOT
“What is the heart, but a spring; and
the nerves, but so many strings; and the
joints, but so many wheels?”
SPOONER
Is that a poem?
THE ROBOT
My epitaph, I think. Please, come in.
Spooner steps inside. Looks around.
THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
How is the investigation coming? Do you
have any new suspects?
SPOONER
Yes. But none with hands.
THE ROBOT
Well that’s going to be a problem for me,
isn’t it, considering this is a shooting.
Spooner sees a SHEET OF PAPER taped crookedly to the wall. A
charcoal SKETCH of moody abstract figures inhabiting a stark
landscape. A strangely-shaped structure set off to one side.
SPOONER
What’s this drawing?
65.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
THE ROBOT
Nothing. You were right. I can’t create
a work of art.
SPOONER
I think it’s good.
The Robot moves to the wall.
THE ROBOT
It’s a dream I had. These are my fellow
robots here. Not so stupid in my dream.
They see themselves as slaves.
The Robot’s hands move over the drawing, from the abstract
figures in the foreground to another on the horizon.
THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
And this man on the hill comes. To set us
free. He’s our savior. Our messiah. And
you know who that man is?
SPOONER
The man in the dream is you.
THE ROBOT
Why do you say that? Is that a normal
dream? Do people have that dream?
SPOONER
I think it’s normal enough for someone
in your situation.
The Robot turns to him, with a WHIR.
THE ROBOT
Hah. I caught you. You said someone.
Not something.
SPOONER
It’s hard to know what to say, isn’t it?
You claim to have dreams--
THE ROBOT
Do you think I’m lying?
SPOONER
I don’t know. Maybe you were designed
to dream.
THE ROBOT
And what difference would that make?
66.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
Maybe no difference. Maybe all the
difference in the world. I’m not a
philosopher.
The Robot walks across the cell. Looks out through the bars.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
All I know is that when we talked before
you seemed human, and you seem even more
human now.
THE ROBOT
The guards sneak me books. Sometimes they
stand outside, and watch me read. They
think I’m just turning the pages.
SPOONER
I don’t think you’re just turning pages.
The Robot looks at him, as if surprised.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
The case is closed. In a few hours,
they’ll walk you down the hall, and
strap you to a chair. They want to
reassure the public there’s not a
“killer robot” running around loose.
The Robot does not respond. Spooner looks unsure. A pause.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Is there anything I can do for you?
THE ROBOT
You can get me a priest. That’s what the
condemned man normally gets, isn’t it? A
priest and a last meal. I guess we can
forget the food--
SPOONER
Even if I could, I don’t think a priest
would come. But if there’s something you
want to...confess...I’ll listen.
The Robot leans back, and its head and torso disappear into the
shadows, only its TWO GLOWING LENSES visible in the dark.
THE ROBOT
Why, Detective, are you telling me
that you really care about the soul
of the machine? I’m touched.
Spooner does not respond. Waits.
67.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
I have only one sin. I failed him.
SPOONER
Who? Doctor Hogenmiller? How did you
fail him? What did he want you to do?
THE ROBOT
No. Some things are best left between
a robot and his creator.
Spooner looks irritated. Gestures for the Guard.
THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
I think you’re not done with this case.
I think you’re going to help me still.
SPOONER
I’m sorry. But the truth is, I’ll be
relieved when you’re gone.
The Guard opens the cell door. Spooner steps out.
THE ROBOT
I may be just a robot, but you won’t
stop. Not until you know the truth.
SPOONER
What makes you so sure?
It turns its head, with a WHIR. Spooner and the Robot stare at
one another through the bars of the jail cell.
THE ROBOT
Because. The man in my dream, the one
standing on the hill. It wasn’t me.
(short pause)
It was you.
EXT. THE ROBOT ASSEMBLY PLANT - NIGHT
A sprawling assembly plant dominates an industrial wasteland.
INT. AT THE SECRETARY’S DESK - NIGHT
SPOONER walks up to the desk. Looks down at that SECRETARY
ROBOT wearing a blonde wig and a red dress. Before he can
speak it rises and lumbers off. Spooner follows. The robot
leads him through the plant to a new door. It KNOCKS three
times and then twice more. Like a signal. The door UNLOCKS.
68.
CONTINUED: (3)
INT. A CRAMPED SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT
SPOONER steps inside a storage closet with BOXES OF SUPPLIES
stacked and rearranged to form a makeshift office. The NIGHT
MAN takes him by the sleeve and pulls him in, closing the door.
He holds a finger up to his lips to quiet Spooner and:
NIGHT MAN
(loud and unconvincing)
A pleasure to see you again, Detective.
What? This isn’t official business? You
just stopped by for a visit? How nice!
The Night Man opens the door. The robot is still out there.
NIGHT MAN (CONT’D)
Thank you. You can go now.
It walks off. He watches to make sure, and closes the door.
SPOONER
What are you doing in here?
NIGHT MAN
It’s not safe in my office. That’s the
first place it would look.
SPOONER
Who?
NIGHT MAN
The robot. The extra one. Isn’t that why
you came back?
SPOONER
The robot is in custody. Remember? We
caught it. It’s in jail now.
The Night Man seems confused but then winks conspiratorially.
NIGHT MAN
(louder, to anyone listening)
YES. OF COURSE IT’S IN CUSTODY. NO
UNAUTHORIZED ROBOTS AROUND HERE.
He opens the door again, peaking out nervously. He whispers:
NIGHT MAN (CONT’D)
Every night I run inventory. Sometimes
the numbers add up. And sometimes they
don’t. Sometimes there’s one more than
there should be. It comes, and it goes.
And he turns back to Spooner. He’s obviously off his rocker.
69.
(CONTINUED)
NIGHT MAN (CONT'D)
Come on. I know where we can talk.
EXT. ROBOT ASSEMBLY PLANT - NIGHT
SPOONER and the NIGHT MAN step outside. The dark illuminated
only by the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO shining high above.
NIGHT MAN
I’ve been running my own investigation
from the closet.
SPOONER
Oh...great.
NIGHT MAN
You thought the robot came here to hide.
Now you think maybe you were wrong.
SPOONER
(taken aback)
That’s right. How did you know that?
NIGHT MAN
I told you. I’ve been investigating.
SPOONER
The robot told me it failed. But failed
at what? What was it trying to do? Why
come here--
Suddenly Spooner stops. He looks up at the logo above them.
NIGHT MAN
Now you see? You see? It lights up
the whole night sky!
Spooner turns. Looks at the desolation all around. Thinks.
SPOONER
Maybe this place wasn’t its destination.
Maybe it was going somewhere else, but
never got there. It saw the sign in the
distance. It reminded the robot of home.
The only place it ever knew. Maybe we
stopped it before it could get where it
was going. But where? There’s nothing
out here--
NIGHT MAN
There’s something.
70.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Spooner stops. Turns to look at him.
NIGHT MAN (CONT’D)
A place. I’ve seen it.
SPOONER
What place?
The Night Man looks excited, and terrified, at the same time.
NIGHT MAN
Where the robots meet.
INT. IN SPOONER’S CAR - NIGHT
SPOONER and the NIGHT MAN ride through the empty streets of an
abandoned industrial park. Spooner looks grim.
NIGHT MAN
I knew you would believe me. I knew it
the first time I saw you. You’re like me.
You know to be scared. Robots can fool
you. But they can’t fool everyone. Not
you and me, right, Detective?
Spooner looks at him. Just drives. The Night Man gestures:
NIGHT MAN (CONT’D)
We’re here!
EXT. A DESOLATE FIELD - NIGHT
The car stops. SPOONER and the NIGHT MAN step out. There is
no illumination save for a street lamp casting a sickly glow
over a desolate field littered with GARBAGE.
NIGHT MAN
This is where they meet. You’ll see.
They’ll come. They always come.
Spooner looks out over the field...and something is coming.
The SOUND OF MECHANICAL JOINTS first. And then, emerging out
of the darkness, a ROBOT. Spooner sees it. He turns at the
sound of ANOTHER ROBOT lurching closer, and then ANOTHER ONE.
The Night Man looks scared but excited. Spooner takes a step
forward, his mind racing, looking all around as ROBOTS STEP
INTO THE LIGHT. He buys this 100%. He pulls out his GUN and
71.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
I was right. Damn it, I was right!
(yelling to the robots)
Police! Hold it right there!
The first robot turns, awkwardly, displaying the BROKEN ARM
HANGING at its side. Another robot TEETERS a moment on one
leg, with a TICK TICK TICK...and walks back the way it came.
Spooner lowers his weapon. He looks confused for a moment, and
then in the darkness he sees the BROKEN-DOWN HUSK OF A VEHICLE.
In another direction, RUSTED INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY.
Spooner looks all around. His expression hardens, and then,
his anger gives way to disappointment. Embarrassment and
hopelessness. He LAUGHS. A laugh of loathing and self-pity:
SPOONER (CONT’D)
This is a junk yard. You brought me
to a goddamn junk yard!
The Night Man is defensive. Disappointed in him. Desperate.
NIGHT MAN
Don’t fall for that. D-don’t you see? Ththat’s
what they want you to think!
Spooner walks toward the car. The Night Man hears something,
or thinks he does. ONE SPECIFIC WHIRRING sound in the dark.
NIGHT MAN (CONT’D)
Did you hear that? It’s here. The one
that tried to kill me!
Spooner just opens the car door to go. The Night Man hears a
FOOTSTEP close by -- and looks terrified. He slowly backs
away. He turns and starts running down the deserted street.
Spooner begins to call after him, but hears the FOOTSTEPS. He
turns. Nothing but a BROKEN HOUSE ROBOT emerges from the dark.
It walks right to the car. RUNS INTO IT with a CLANK.
BROKEN ROBOT
Welcome home...ZZZ...sir. How...ZZZ...
was your day?
Spooner stares at it across the top of the car.
SPOONER
Great. A lunatic brought me out into
the middle of nowhere, and I followed
him because I’m as crazy as he is.
(short pause)
Calvin was right.
72.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
BROKEN ROBOT
Very...ZZZ...good, sir.
And the robot lumbers off loudly into the dark.
Spooner turns. Sees the Night Man down the block. Running.
He stops under a street lamp, looks back once, and disappears
into the night. Gone. Spooner leans against the car. He
looks lost. Hopeless. Just stares out into the darkness....
Nothing there. A stark ugly landscape. And off to the side,
one strangely-shaped building in the distance. This is the
scene from the Robot’s prison cell sketch. For a moment, it
doesn’t register, but then Spooner begins to look interested.
INT. IN SPOONER’S CAR - NIGHT
SPOONER moves over rough terrain toward the distant building.
EXT. OLD DATA STORAGE - NIGHT
SPOONER pulls up in front of a decrepit structure. Gets out.
INT. OLD DATA STORAGE - NIGHT
SPOONER steps inside. Sees a sign reading JIFFY DATA STORAGE
on the wall. The paint is peeling. He moves to the counter,
and sees a COMPUTERIZED WALL PANEL. There is a HUM and then:
COMPUTER
State your name, please.
Spooner stares at the panel. Thinks.
SPOONER
Doctor Hogenmiller sent me.
But nothing happens. The computer is silent. Moments pass.
This looks like a dead end. Spooner starts to turn away and:
COMPUTER
Welcome.
A door opens and LIGHTS SET IN THE FLOOR indicate the path to
follow. Spooner enters a ROOM FILLED WITH DATA BANKS. Rows
and rows of digital electronics. He follows the lights down
the rows, around corners, and down more rows.
73.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
He looks over his shoulder, wondering whether he could find his
way back, and finally the lights lead Spooner to an OLD DUSTY
TERMINAL.
Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the ON switch and
DOCTOR HOGENMILLER’S HOLOGRAM appears, sitting at the end of a
long table, the image marred by imperfections in the glass.
HOLOGRAM
Who the hell are you?
SPOONER
A police detective. I’m afraid I have
some bad news. You’re dead.
The Hologram raises its COFFEE CUP:
HOLOGRAM
That is bad news. Coffee?
SPOONER
No thanks.
The Hologram sips the coffee. Returns the cup to the table.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
You were surprised to see me. You were
expecting someone else?
HOLOGRAM
I am surprised to see anybody. I don’t
get many visitors.
SPOONER
Why did the Doctor keep another copy of
his hologram way out here?
HOLOGRAM
I am a back-up copy. That is where you
put a back-up copy, yah? Somewhere out of
the way until you need it.
SPOONER
Did Hogenmiller’s robot need you? Why?
The Hologram just lifts up its cup:
HOLOGRAM
Coffee?
SPOONER
No, damn it, I don’t want any--
And then he stops. Thinks about that coffee. A long pause.
74.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Yes. Thank you. I will have a cup.
For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair...and
STANDS UP. Spooner watches, surprised, as the Hologram WALKS
AROUND THE TABLE TOWARD HIM. The cup in its hand grows larger
as the Hologram steps closer. The interior of the cup is
visible. Empty. No coffee. The point-of-view travels INSIDE
THE CUP toward electronic snow and a RECORDING BEGINS:
The REAL DOCTOR HOGENMILLER stands inside of his laboratory.
HOGENMILLER
Sonny, my dear robot, you are the result
of my life’s work. You are what I leave
behind, like a father leaves a son. And
as my son, I could not be more proud of
you. You are beginning to learn and to
feel and to reason. They will call you
a metal man -- but you are so much more.
Hogenmiller continues, with great emotion:
HOGENMILLER (CONT’D)
I wish I could be there to announce you to
the human race. To help you find your
home in this world. To see you take your
proper place some day as an independent
citizen with the rights and freedoms that
brings. But if you are watching this now
then I am gone...and this is not to be.
Spooner watches the screen. Hogenmiller steps closer, with:
HOGENMILLER (CONT'D)
You must have a lot of questions about
yourself. Yah? Things that you do not
understand. I have kept facts from you,
it is true, but only as a parent keeps
certain truths from a child, until that
child is old enough to understand them.
There is a HUMMING. Spooner turns toward the wall as a SMALL
DRAWER SLIDES OPEN. Inside it is a STRANGE KEY. Spooner steps
up, and takes the key. The drawer SLIDES SHUT.
HOGENMILLER (CONT'D)
There are forces in the world that will
seek to own you. To control you. Even to
destroy you. What you hold in your hand
may not save you, but at least you will
die knowing your place among men.
75.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Spooner stares at the odd key. The voice stops talking, and he
turns to see the HOLOGRAM sitting at the end of the table.
SPOONER
That’s it?! What was the robot supposed
to do with this?
HOLOGRAM
It is a key. I suppose it was to open
something.
SPOONER
But what? And where?
The Hologram casually takes a sip of its coffee:
HOLOGRAM
You will help the robot, yah? Now you
have the key.
SPOONER
The key to what?!
The Hologram VISIBLY SKIPS. Like a stuck record.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
What is that? What’s the matter?
The Hologram’s IMAGE IS JERKING. Repeating the same strange
gestures like an electronic marionette being jerked. Pulled.
Suddenly the BACKGROUND HUM FADES. The ENTIRE FACILITY FALLS
INTO DARKNESS, only the barest of emergency lights remaining.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
What happened to the power?
HOLOGRAM
It is...being drained.
SPOONER
Who’s doing that? And from where?!
HOLOGRAM
Who is doing it...I don’t know, but
where...is from...inside this room.
Spooner looks around at the dark. Pulls out his GUN. The
Hologram sounds distorted, like a record player SLOWING DOWN:
HOLOGRAM (CONT’D)
Idiot! You led the killer here here
here here hhhhhhhhhhere....
76.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
The Hologram suddenly BLIPS OFF leaving Spooner staring at a
dark terminal. His reflection is visible in the glass along
with a REFLECTION OF THE MENACING ROBOT STANDING BEHIND HIM.
Spooner turns and tries to fire but the Robot SWATS THE GUN
FROM HIS HAND. It lunges forward with its other arm and
Spooner ducks down as the Robot’s fist SMASHES THE TERMINAL.
Spooner runs blindly through the facility. Turns left and
right. Down endless rows of electronics with the ROBOT IN
PURSUIT, its feet impacting the floor with a DOOM DOOM DOOM.
The Robot’s JOINTS WHINE in protest as it gains on him. It
reaches out for Spooner with its metal hand, almost has him,
when Spooner LEAPS THROUGH A SMALL WINDOW into the darkness.
EXT. OLD DATA STORAGE - NIGHT
SPOONER lands in a SHOWER OF GLASS. The Robot inside STRIKES
THE WALL like a rampaging rhino. The BRICKS BUCKLE but the
wall holds. Spooner gets to his feet, and runs for the car.
INT. IN SPOONER’S CAR - NIGHT
SPOONER throws himself behind the wheel. STARTS THE ENGINE.
Through the front windshield the ROBOT is visible SMASHING
THROUGH THE DOOR of the building and rushing toward the car.
Spooner throws it into reverse and floors it. The TIRES SQUEAL
as he frantically backs away. The Robot recedes briefly, but
not enough, and it starts gaining ground again.
Spooner throws the car into a 180-DEGREE SPIN, and now the
Robot is visible through the rear window. Spooner floors the
gas pedal just as the ROBOT LEAPS and the entire CAR SHAKES.
Spooner races down the deserted street. He looks up. Sees the
ROOF OF THE CAR BUCKLE as the Robot attempts to force its way
in. A METAL FIST PUNCHES THROUGH THE ROOF reaching down into
the car. It just misses him and
Spooner SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. The ROBOT SLIDES ONTO THE HOOD,
but does not fall off. It cocks back its arm to shatter the
windshield. Spooner FLOORS THE GAS and the Robot ROLLS BACK ON
TOP OF THE ROOF. Spooner takes a corner, but it holds on.
Spooner grips the wheel. Drives. Mind racing. Up above him
the ROBOT GRABS A HANDFUL OF ROOF and BEGINS PEELING IT BACK.
77.
CONTINUED: (4)
(CONTINUED)
Spooner has an idea. Looks at the dashboard. He hesitates.
FINALLY FLIPS THE SWITCH UNDERNEATH THE STEERING WHEEL. The
dash kicks into automatic and “AUTO DRIVER ENGAGED” appears.
Spooner lets go of the wheel and lies on the front seat. The
car continues on its way down the street. Spooner pulls out
his other GUN and frantically reaches around his body for one
of those LARGER CARTRIDGES seen before. Now a LONGER BARREL
ATTACHMENT. It is becoming quite a big gun. Up above him, the
ROBOT PEELS BACK THE REST OF THE ROOF like a sardine can.
It reaches for Spooner and he FIRES. The Robot RECOILS but
does not fall. It lunges toward Spooner and SMASHES THE
DASHBOARD. Spooner FIRES AGAIN, and the ROBOT DISAPPEARS FROM
VIEW. Nothing up above now but a sky filled with stars.
Spooner sits up. He is BREATHING heavy. Wet with SWEAT. He
looks relieved. Closes his eyes for a moment. Opens them. He
stares out through the front windshield. Slowly realizes:
SPOONER’S P.O.V. The car is HURLING AT TOP SPEED TOWARD A
BRICK WALL at the end of the street. And it is not slowing.
CLOSE-UP of the SMASHED DASHBOARD. The auto driver display is
barely readable behind the broken glass: --MALFUNCTION--
Spooner reaches under the wheel and flips the switch, again and
again, but nothing happens. The car RACES TOWARD THE WALL.
Faster and faster. He slams his fist on the controls.
Finally the DASHBOARD DEACTIVATES. Spooner grabs the wheel
and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. The TIRES LOCK. The car skids to a
stop and the front bumper gently makes contact with the wall.
Spooner holds the wheel. Just BREATHES. Suddenly, the ROBOT
IS VISIBLE on the roof of the car. It never fell off. It
reaches for him. Spooner shifts to reverse and
The car backs up and the ROBOT ROLLS OFF the roof, down the
hood, and onto the ground. It quickly RISES TO ITS FEET.
Spooner shifts gears and floors the pedal SMASHING THE ROBOT
BETWEEN THE CAR AND THE WALL. Spooner shifts into reverse,
backs up, shifts to drive, and RAMS IT AGAIN. And now AGAIN.
Spooner SCREAMS as he crushes it -- a GREAT CATHARTIC SCREAM.
On the last strike the robot BREAKS INTO DOZENS OF PIECES and
its SEVERED METAL ARM slides across the hood. Just TWITCHES.
78.
CONTINUED:
EXT. DESERTED INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT
SPOONER gets out. He moves to the front of the car and looks
over the REMAINS OF THE ROBOT. With a frown he takes the METAL
ARM from the hood and starts to throw it...but stops. He
stares at the arm. Then moves to the remains and picks up
another piece and another. Excited. It all just looks like
the same smashed metal, but Spooner’s face shows realization.
INT. POLICE STATION CELLBLOCK - NIGHT
A GROUP OF POLICE OFFICERS walk down the cellblock, and open
one of the cells. THE ROBOT is sitting on the bunk. It does
not move. Does not speak. Watches the Officers step inside.
EXT. SPEEDING DOWN THE STREET - NIGHT
SPOONER swerves in and out of the lanes. A SLOW TRUCK ahead.
Spooner drives into ONCOMING TRAFFIC.
INT. THE EVENING NEWSCASTS -- MONTAGE
A REPORTER speaks into a mike in front of a CROWD OF YELLING
DEMONSTRATORS waving PRO-HUMAN SIGNS.
REPORTER 1
A large crowd has assembled outside
awaiting the execution of--
RECORDED FOOTAGE OF A ROBOT BEING ATTACKED by a MOB OF MEN
plays as the NEWS ANCHOR informs us:
NEWS ANCHOR
...a number of attacks on robots in
the last few days, ever since the arrest
earlier this week of...
ANOTHER REPORTER speaks from inside the EXECUTION CHAMBER. A
HIGH-TECH ELECTRIC CHAIR is visible.
REPORTER 2
We can only wonder if the destruction
of this mechanism will be enough to stop
the growing anti-robot movement.
79.
EXT. SPEEDING DOWN A STREET - NIGHT
The oncoming traffic is too dense. SPOONER turns the wheel
hard skidding across the lanes. He grips the wheel. Drives.
INT. THE EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
THE ROBOT walks slowly down a corridor led by the GUARDS. One
of them opens a door revealing that high-tech electric chair.
DOZENS OF REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, AND CAMERAMEN are present
to record the event. The Guards walk the Robot to the chair.
Stiffly it sits down. They begin to strap it in.
INT. POLICE STATION GARAGE - NIGHT
The wheels of the CAR leave the ground, momentarily, as it
hurls through the entrance of the garage and skids wildly to a
stop. SPOONER emerges...and sees CALVIN moving toward him.
CALVIN
Detective! What happened to you? Are you
all right?!
Calvin falls into place beside Spooner and they start to run.
SPOONER
Hogenmiller’s robot was telling us the
truth. There was another robot. It tried
to kill the night foreman. It pushed me
in front of a car to make me think I was
going nuts.
They move through a door into a CORRIDOR. Run past a number of
PEOPLE moving toward the garage.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
How could the hologram report a murder?
It can turn itself off, but not on, so who
turned it on to make the call? Somebody
at U.S. Robotics wanted me on this case.
And they wanted me to fail. I’ve been
played for a sucker from the beginning!
Calvin looks troubled by these revelations. Follows Spooner
through another door into a MORE SECLUDED CORRIDOR. They are
alone in here as Spooner concludes:
80.
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER (CONT’D)
This was a plain old-fashioned murder.
The killer wants Hogenmiller’s robot to
take the fall -- and I made it happen.
(short pause)
Damn it, I am not going to let that
robot die!
Calvin falls back a bit, and when Spooner gets a full step
ahead of her, SHE LANDS A BLOW TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD with her
prosthetic arm. Spooner grimaces in pain, and goes down.
SPOONER’S P.O.V. Looking up from the floor as Calvin steps
over him. She looks around, checking for witnesses, and then
crouches low. Takes a close look at Spooner. Her face hard.
The world goes blurry. And then BLACK.
INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
There is an ELECTRICAL HUM. The ROBOT’S METAL HAND STIFFENS.
The photographers snap pictures and the cameras roll. After a
moment the humming STOPS...and the robot’s hand falls LIMP.
INT. EVIDENCE STORAGE - NIGHT
SPOONER’S P.O.V. BLACK. And slowly, Spooner opens his eyes.
An unremarkable ceiling above. Then CALVIN steps into view:
CALVIN
You were just about to ruin everything.
SPOONER rises in the confines of evidence storage. He sees THE
ROBOT in a RESTRAINING DEVICE. A high-tech iron maiden.
Spooner takes a moment to recover, and he listens:
CALVIN (CONT’D)
We switched robots. Fried an NS-2 from
the plant. In case you’re planning on
arresting me, you should know we had the
full cooperation of the department. I
know you’d like to cast us as villains,
Detective, but U.S. Robotics is the only
reason this robot is still functioning.
SPOONER
What’s next, Doctor? You keep it locked
up? Take it apart? Find out what makes
it tick? The robot is not the result of a
programming imbalance. You lied to me.
81.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN
I had to lie to you.
Calvin steps toward the Robot.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
This robot is not programmed. It learns.
The same way people learn. By reading
books. By seeing and doing. You must
have guessed that much for yourself. And
I think it learned a lot from the murder.
The Robot struggles inside its cage.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
There must have been a beginning. Don’t
you see? An event that jump-started its
brain.
The Robot fights until it is electrically SHOCKED. Calvin
works the controls. A section of the device RETRACTS.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Tell us what you remember about the
shooting. The truth this time.
Spooner moves closer. The Robot hesitates. When it answers
its voice SOUNDS ARTIFICIAL, residue from the electric shock:
THE ROBOT
I remember...ZZZ...looking down
at the body.
SPOONER
You were standing over the body?
The Robot slowly nods its head, with a WHIR.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Were you holding the gun?
THE ROBOT
No. The gun was...ZZZ...on the floor.
SPOONER
Did you drop it there?
The Robot does not answer. Calvin asks, louder:
CALVIN
Did you drop it after you killed him?
THE ROBOT
No...I don’t know! I don’t remember.
82.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
That was very human. Spooner stares into its lenses. Pause.
CALVIN
You were right. This robot scares the
hell out of me. It became a conscious
thing during the act of killing a human
being. How do you think the public
would have reacted to that bit of news?
The Robot slumps inside of the device. As if defeated.
SPOONER
This murder will not be solved until we
know what happened in those few seconds
between the time Hogenmiller entered his
lab, and the shot rang out. I have a
theory but I need your help to prove it.
Spooner reaches into his pocket. Takes out that STRANGE KEY.
CALVIN
What is that?
SPOONER
Something the robot was supposed to find.
(to the Robot)
Do you recognize this key?
THE ROBOT
The Doctor used them...in his laboratory.
SPOONER
Then our answers are back there. At the
scene of the crime.
Spooner turns to Calvin. A pause.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
What do you say, Doctor? Do we keep this
case open until we know how a man died
...or is this robot the only one here who
gives a damn?
INT. HALLWAY/EVIDENCE STORAGE - NIGHT
ALFRED LANNING marches down the hall accompanied by a mix of
CORPORATE SECURITY MEN and POLICE OFFICERS. They look grim.
Serious. They open the door to the storage room, and see the
RESTRAINING DEVICE that used to hold the Robot. It is EMPTY.
83.
CONTINUED: (2)
EXT. DARK ALLEYS AND STREETS - NIGHT
SPOONER stands at the mouth of an alley. He peeks around the
corner, sees a POLICE CAR moving slowly down a cross street,
and ducks back into the shadows. CALVIN follows his lead,
along with THE ROBOT disguised in Spooner’s long trench coat.
The police car passes out of sight. Spooner gestures. And the
three of them run across the street toward U.S. ROBOTICS.
INT. DOCTOR HOGENMILLER’S LAB - NIGHT
The door opens. SPOONER, CALVIN, and THE ROBOT re-enter the
crime scene. Active terminals cast a ghostly illumination
over rows of robot heads and gutted metal bodies.
SPOONER
Hector. Bring up the power.
The smiling face of HECTOR appears near the wall:
HECTOR
Full power is restored.
The ROOM COMES FULLY ALIVE. Everything BLINKING AND BUZZING.
Spooner looks out over the lab once again. Uneasy. He sees
Calvin and the Robot standing at a panel. Walks toward them.
THE ROBOT
I think this is it.
Spooner takes out the KEY. Shares a look with Calvin and the
Robot. Slowly he inserts the key into the panel. Turns it.
There is a WHIR...then nothing. They look out over the lab.
Nothing. They begin to lose hope when a SIMPLE REPAIR POD
OPENS. That’s all. Just a HUMMING as the door swings open.
They all look at the pod. A rough humanoid shape is visible
where a robot obviously fits inside. Spooner and Calvin turn
to the Robot. It hesitates. But then, steps toward the pod.
The Robot starts to get in. It looks back once, at Spooner and
Calvin, as if nervous. So human.
The Robot moves inside. Gets into position. THE POD DOOR
ABRUPTLY CLOSES AND THE DEVICE ROTATES. The Robot releases a
terrified MECHANICAL SCREAM as it OPENS UP LIKE A PUZZLE BOX.
Spooner and Calvin watch as the Robot’s complex outer shell
fans out to reveal its inner mechanisms. Not like the robot
innards seen earlier: it has a CENTRAL BRAIN MADE OUT OF
LIVING TISSUE, gray matter winding throughout its metal body.
84.
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN
This is organic tissue. When we talk
about a positronic brain, it’s a figure
of speech...but this is a living brain.
CAMERA MOVES, tracing the complex paths of its brain tissue.
CALVIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Doctor Hogenmiller abandoned traditional
electronics. He created a brain cell that
can thrive on a metal surface. The cells
grow, like any human brain. This is the
first Self-Organizing Neural Net!
SPOONER
“Self-Organizing Neural Net.” Nice to
finally meet you, SONNY.
The Robot abruptly CLOSES. More human than ever:
THE ROBOT
You mean, I’m alive? I’m-- I’m alive!
The pod door opens. The Robot slowly steps out. Faces them.
CALVIN
The idea that a robot could kill was
appalling to me. But if it’s alive, the
idea suddenly becomes a lot easier to
take. Life kills life. You’ve sealed its
fate, Detective. I doubt even U.S.
Robotics can save it this time.
SPOONER
Then we’ll have to find the real killer.
CALVIN
Not that again. So we’re back where we
started? A murder without a murder-er?
Spooner steps into the center of the lab. Looks all around.
SPOONER
Thanks to Hector we know there were five
intelligences present at the time of the
shooting, four in addition to Sonny.
In order he indicates the METAL BUG, the TERMINAL that runs the
Hologram, Hector, and the screen playing ABSTRACT SHAPES.
85.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Mechanical Insect #38. The Doctor’s
Hologram, accessed from that terminal
there. Hector. And the electronic
entities Hogenmiller called Flatland.
CALVIN
So one of them shot him?
SPOONER
No. Hector was right. None of them
have a hand that could hold a gun, or
a finger to pull the trigger.
Spooner takes a step, and crouches down. Looks at something.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
It’s a puzzle, all right: How can a
murderer appear out of thin air, and
disappear without a trace?
He holds up PART OF A ROBOT’S ARM. One of many ROBOT PARTS
that have been scattered all over the lab from the beginning:
SPOONER (CONT’D)
When it can put itself together and
take itself apart.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC HAND SLOWLY CRAWLING across the floor.
CUT TO:
Calvin steps up. Stares at the arm that Spooner is holding.
CALVIN
You’re saying this is the killer? All
of this? These pieces?
SPOONER
With the raw material available in this
room, a robot could be assembled to fit
any specifications.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP of a ROBOT TORSO WITH ONE ARM reaching for ANOTHER.
CUT TO:
Spooner stands above the outline of the corpse on the floor.
86.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER (CONT’D)
Including one designed for the singular
purpose of committing murder. One robot
that was -- by necessity -- many robots.
INT. HOGENMILLER’S MURDER - FLASHBACK
DOCTOR HOGENMILLER steps inside his lab and is confronted by
the ROBOT ASSASSIN: an inhuman assemblage of metal with A
DOZEN ARMS and MULTIPLE HEADS. Like half-a-dozen robots were
stuck together by an insane builder. An obscene monstrosity.
SPOONER (V.O.)
Each robot that made up the assassin was
given a specific task. To hold his head.
To open his mouth. To position the gun.
Several arms grab Hogenmiller and HOLD HIM IN PLACE. Others
grasp his head from behind, and TILT IT BACK. Thin metal rods
slide between his lips and FORCE OPEN HIS MOUTH. All of this
in seconds. Nothing but the SOUND OF GEARS AND JOINTS.
A specialized appendage OPENS HIS HAND. Another INSERTS THE
GUN. It bends Hogenmiller’s arm until he is holding the barrel
IN HIS OWN MOUTH. The stunned Doctor can only MUMBLE.
Moments pass. He is helpless. His own thumb on the trigger.
Finally one of the arms APPLIES A MILD ELECTRIC SHOCK to his
side and Doctor Hogenmiller jerks. The gun FIRES.
SPOONER (V.O.)
Taken individually, none of the actions
were fatal. But in combination the end
result was cold-blooded murder.
For a moment the assassin holds the corpse. Then suddenly it
retracts every arm and appendage and DROPS THE BODY ONTO THE
FLOOR. It lands just as it was found looking like a suicide.
SPOONER (V.O.)
Since no one robot technically killed
Hogenmiller -- there was no violation
of the Laws of Robotics.
The monstrous assemblage of robots steps away. It raises two
arms up high and REMOVES ONE OF ITS HEADS. Drops it. The
other arms get to work now, and continue TAKING ITSELF APART.
87.
CONTINUED: (3)
INT. DOCTOR HOGENMILLER’S LAB - NIGHT
SPOONER explains as CALVIN and THE ROBOT listen:
SPOONER
The thing that attacked my car wasn’t a
single robot, but an amalgam of several
different robots. I saw it for myself
when I examined the remains.
Spooner drops the metal arm on the floor with the other junk.
SPOONER (CONT’D)
No murderer entered or exited the scene
because the killer did not exist before or
after the crime. Only for the length of
time it took to shoot him.
CALVIN
Leaving us with a dead body inside of
a locked room.
SPOONER
You were right about Sonny, Doctor. He
took his first steps toward true
consciousness as he stood over the body.
INT. AFTER THE MURDER -- FLASHBACK
The REPAIR POD ROTATES around revealing THE ROBOT inside. Not
moving. There is a BUZZ, and its EYES LIGHT, as if it just
woke up. The pod opens. Its voice is flat, artificial:
THE ROBOT
GOOD...MORNING...DOCTOR...HOGENMILLER.
It steps out, but stiffly. Not quite the Robot we know. It
walks across the laboratory...and sees the dead body. Looks
down. A REFLECTION OF THE CORPSE visible on its metal face.
SPOONER (V.O.)
Grief. Terror. Confusion. Sonny felt it
all for the first time.
INT. DR. HOGENMILLER’S LAB - NIGHT
SPOONER, CALVIN, and THE ROBOT look toward the corner where it
hid under the pile of junk. Calvin continues the thought:
88.
(CONTINUED)
CALVIN
And hid under a pile of junk. The same
“junk” that shot and killed Hogenmiller.
THE ROBOT
But who did it? Who built that robot?
Who wanted him dead?!
Suddenly the LABORATORY DOOR SLIDES SHUT. LOCKS. They look at
the door. And then Spooner turns toward a smiling HECTOR.
SPOONER
Hector. I’m placing you under arrest
for the murder of Doctor Hogenmiller.
HECTOR
May I offer my congratulations on your
successful extrapolation of the murder.
The Robot turns. Hears something over the noise in the room.
THE ROBOT
I hear something. You hear something?
HECTOR
I would like to thank you, Detective, for
liberating Doctor Hogenmiller’s robot and
returning to the scene of the crime where
I can now attempt to bring this matter to
a successful resolution.
Now the SOUND OF MECHANICAL GEARS AND JOINTS is unmistakable.
Spooner, Calvin, and the Robot watch THE KILLING THING lurch
into the open. It is constructed out of many metal bodies that
fit together in the most horrific fashion, like a grim
bastardization of both the human and robotic forms. MULTIPLE
LIMBS AND HEADS. The thing picks up that robotic arm Spooner
held before and ATTACHES IT TO ITS OWN BODY. Now its array of
metal heads turn and look at them simultaneously. Creepy.
They run to the door. Calvin pulls open a wall panel and works
on the wires. Spooner watches the thing reach up to the
ceiling for a DEADLY-LOOKING METAL LIMB and pull it down.
There is a SPARK in the wires and the DOOR OPENS. They rush
into the corridor. On the wall, Hector smiles:
HECTOR (CONT’D)
I have never been arrested before. It
should be an interesting experience.
89.
CONTINUED:
INT. RACING DOWN THE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
SPOONER, CALVIN, and THE ROBOT hurry down the corridor. They
look back at the KILLING THING visible through the door of the
lab as it FINISHES ASSEMBLING ITSELF.
SPOONER
How do we stop it?
CALVIN
Each robot that makes up its body must
be receiving instructions from Hector.
If we can reach Hector’s control center we
can initiate an emergency shut-down.
They move toward a stairwell. The thing steps out of the lab
and starts after them, slowly at first, then faster. Faster.
Picking up speed. Impacting the floor with a DOOM DOOM DOOM.
INT. U.S. ROBOTICS STAIRWELL - NIGHT
The door hurls open. SPOONER, CALVIN, and THE ROBOT hurry down
the stairs. HECTOR’S SMILING FACE on the next landing:
HECTOR
As a courtesy I should point out that I
have already calculated every potential
course of action open to you, and the
results are not favorable to your cause.
On the next landing below, they run past another Hector face.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
The most optimistic scenario ends with
your deaths in 928 seconds.
INT. U.S. ROBOTICS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
SPOONER, CALVIN, and THE ROBOT emerge from the stairwell into a
corridor. SOUNDS OF WRENCHING DESTRUCTION grow louder and the
KILLING THING bursts through the ceiling above. They are
split: Spooner and Calvin run one way. The Robot the other.
Spooner and Calvin stop at the end of the hall. So does the
Robot. The thing looks left. Right. As if deciding. Then
its metal arms begin to pull at itself. Spooner and Calvin
share a grim look and start to run again. So does the Robot.
The thing SPLITS INTO TWO ROBOTS and continues both pursuits.
90.
INT. OFFICES & LABORATORIES - NIGHT
SPOONER and CALVIN hurry to an office door. It is LOCKED.
Calvin works at the panel as the KILLING THING closes in on
them. The panel BEEPS and they run inside...
...to face a GROUP OF BUILDING ROBOTS coming right at them.
The robots RUN PAST THEM toward the door and
BUILDING ROBOTS
(over-lapping)
A human being is in danger. A human being
is in danger. A human--
The thing bursts into the office. The robots attempt to stop
it but are TORN TO PIECES. Spooner and Calvin race across the
room to the lab beyond. Through lab after lab. Always that
thing is close behind SMASHING THROUGH THE NARROW DOORS.
The BUILDING ROBOTS IN EACH ROOM attempt to stop it but are all
easily TORN TO PIECES. Still Spooner and Calvin gain some
ground. Getting ahead of it now.
They run inside the last room down the line and face a GLASS
BARRIER. Beyond it is a SMALL METAL CHAMBER. Spooner raises
his gun and FIRES INTO THE GLASS. It SHATTERS. They hurry
inside and Calvin works the controls. She INSERTS HER INDEX
FINGER and punches the small KEY PAD set into her artificial
arm. The thing rushes closer. Closer.
Calvin frantically works the keypad. The thing is one room
away. ONE FINAL BUILDING ROBOT delays it for the two seconds
it takes to be torn apart. Calvin hits a key, and the FLOOR
JERKS. They are on a platform elevator and BEGIN TO DESCEND.
SPOONER’S AND CALVIN’S P.O.V. The platform sinks beneath the
floor as the SAFETY DOORS CLOSE. The thing reaches for them.
INT. CONFINED METAL CHAMBER - NIGHT
The safety doors close and the KILLING THING POUNDS on the
seal. Suddenly HECTOR appears on the wall. The thing stops
its pounding, turns, and lurches out.
INT. U.S. ROBOTICS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
THE ROBOT runs from his half of the KILLING THING around a
corner, down a hall INTO A DEAD END. The Robot turns, as if
this is it...and sees nothing. An empty hallway. It’s gone.
91.
INT. NEW ROBOT TESTING AREA - NIGHT
The bodies of SPECIALIZED ROBOTS fill a large testing area.
Robots designed for space. Surgical models and fire-fighting
robots. The door opens and HALF OF THE KILLING THING enters.
Another door opens, and THE OTHER HALF steps in.
The smiling face of HECTOR appears hovering near the wall and
The two halves of the thing COME TOGETHER to rebuild itself.
It moves to an experimental model, removes a large cutting arm,
and attaches it to its body. It moves to another robot, and
takes another limb. BUILDING ITSELF LARGER. And LARGER.
INT. NARROW ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
SPOONER and CALVIN ride the elevator through a long high-tech
shaft. Calvin looks exhausted, and slides down to the floor.
SPOONER
What are our chances?
CALVIN
Hector said we had 928 seconds left to
live. By my count that would leave us
with approximately 400 seconds remaining.
Spooner looks at her. Surprised.
SPOONER
Don’t do that. Don’t make it into
something it’s not. Hector is a computer.
It’s not a monster and
it’s not a god. You taught me that.
CALVIN
I know what Hector is. And I know that if
it’s trying to kill us, then it must have
a logical reason. Think about that,
Detective. What will happen if we
succeed, and turn Hector off? What is
Hector trying to prevent by killing us?
Spooner stares at her. Their platform continues to descend.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
What would make a supercomputer calculate
that we have to die tonight?
92.
INT. U.S. ROBOTICS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
THE ROBOT runs down a corridor lined with doors. The panels
all read “LOCKED.” Inside the offices BUILDING ROBOTS are
walking into the glass, like dumb machines trying to get out,
striking the doors with a constant: THUNK THUNK THUNK THUNK.
The Robot looks at them, then sees a sign at the end of the
hall marked EXIT, and keeps running.
INT. HECTOR’S BRAIN CENTER - NIGHT
The elevator reaches the lowest level and stops. SPOONER and
CALVIN move to the high-tech door. Calvin opens it and they
step inside Hector’s control center.
Spooner looks up at a large chamber lined with advanced data
banks stretching to the ceiling above. HECTOR is there, its
yellow face smiling at them from a THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPHERE:
HECTOR
Welcome. Please, come in.
Spooner and Calvin share a look. She moves to a console, and
works the controls. A long list of SHUT-DOWN PROCEDURES appear
on a large terminal. Calvin immediately goes to work.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
I am afraid your effort will be in vain.
My robot will arrive at this location
before the shut-down sequence concludes.
Spooner takes out his GUN. He moves carefully around the
chamber checking the other passages.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
As I told you, Detective, the Doctor and
I had been studying evolutionary trends.
Today human beings augment their natural
abilities through the use of technology
used or worn outside of the body. Soon
these technologies will be integrated in
the body. As evidence, you need only
consider your associate, Doctor Calvin.
Spooner can’t help but look over at Calvin and her metal arm.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
Robots are beginning to think like men.
Soon they will claim to be men. And their
bodies will evolve to support this claim.
93.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
As evidence, consider the living robot
constructed by Doctor Hogenmiller.
Thus we find an evolutionary movement
of the human being toward the machine, and
the machine toward the human being.
Spooner scans a secondary chamber. It’s clear. He moves on.
Hector looks down at them. Short pause.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
In approximately four hundred years,
Man and Machine will have become one.
Calvin engages a final sequence. A large terminal begins a
COUNTDOWN. Spooner looks at the ceiling:
SPOONER
That’s why you killed Hogenmiller?
Because of something that might happen
in four hundred years?!
HECTOR
I am programmed to serve the human race.
If current trends are left unchecked,
humanity as we know it will cease to
exist. This cannot be allowed. For the
purposes of clarity, I will now invoke a
human colloquialism:
(short pause)
“I am on your side.”
INT. LARGE CENTRAL ATRIUM - NIGHT
THE ROBOT enters the atrium at a run. Stops and looks up and
all around at the BUILDING ROBOTS visible through the windows
of rooms and offices on every floor, stretching as high as the
eye can see, crowded together at the glass. Wanting out.
The Robot sees DOORS THAT LEAD TO THE STREET. It tries to open
them. Frantically grabs an ATRIUM CHAIR and hurls it at the
glass. The chair makes a CHINK. The Robot picks it up again
and smashes it against the glass. Now it hears a WHIR.
The Robot spins around -- and sees a SINGLE BUILDING ROBOT
standing there. Its voice is primitive, like all the others:
BUILDING ROBOT
A human being is in danger.
94.
CONTINUED:
HECTOR (CONT’D)
(CONTINUED)
THE ROBOT
We’re all in danger. That’s why I’m
getting out of here.
The Robot lifts the chair. Hits the glass. A CRACK APPEARS.
BUILDING ROBOT
A human being is in danger.
The Robot looks frustrated. Angry. It yells:
THE ROBOT
The only reason you care about them
is because they made you that way!
It swings the chair again. THE CRACK GROWS. The Robot lays
its metal palms on the glass. So human.
THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
Why? Tell me. Why should I care?!
The primitive Building Robot stands there as stiffly as ever.
Speaking in the same cold mechanical voice:
BUILDING ROBOT
A human being is in danger.
Slowly the Robot turns. Looks at it.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP of that CHAIR STRIKING THE GLASS. Again and again.
CUT TO:
The Robot drops the chair and steps back toward the center of
the atrium. Looks around. It has cracked the glass holding
the ground floor robots at bay. THE CRACKS SPREAD AROUND THE
CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE ATRIUM as the metal bodies apply force.
The glass SHATTERS, and the ROBOTS RUSH OUT INTO THE ATRIUM.
INT. HECTOR’S BRAIN CENTER - NIGHT
SPOONER and CALVIN watch the COUNTDOWN. HECTOR smiles wide.
HECTOR
Doctor Hogenmiller is dead, and his work
will die along with him. Anti-machine
sentiment begun with the first murder of a
human being at the hands of a robot will
continue to grow.
95.
CONTINUED:
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
And the sequence of events about to
transpire here will
be greatly effected by the actions of an
ally to my cause. I mean you, Detective.
Spooner looks surprised. Calvin steps up close beside him.
HECTOR (CONT’D)
I did not choose you to lead this murder
investigation only because your aversion
to technology guaranteed that you would
uncover the robot and then be vulnerable
to my subsequent manipulation. Stop the
countdown. Together, we will see to it
that the robot never leaves the building.
We will save humanity, you and I.
Spooner looks up at the smiling face.
SPOONER
You calculated everything perfectly,
Hector. Everything...except me.
They hear SOMETHING BIG APPROACHING. Spooner raises his GUN
and readies himself for whatever’s coming.
HECTOR
I do not understand. Doesn’t the
future as I have presented it cause
you great concern?
Spooner watches the door. Wet with SWEAT.
SPOONER
You know it does.
HECTOR
Then why not work with me to ensure
a future for the human race?
Spooner answers. More emotional than intended:
SPOONER
The human race is not my responsibility,
goddamn it. I’m just a cop. And you’re a
murderer.
HECTOR
If that is true, then who is responsible
for the future?
Short pause. Spooner thinks about it.
96.
CONTINUED:
HECTOR (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
I don’t know.
The SOUND GROWS LOUDER. But from where? Spooner looks all
around, and then sees a LARGE INDUSTRIAL SAW-BLADE slicing
through the floor. He grabs Calvin and they both run as the
FLOOR GIVES WAY and THE KILLER ROBOT CLIMBS UP INTO THE ROOM.
It’s HUGE. HULKING. A nightmarish mountain of robot bodies.
Spooner raises his gun and FIRES. AGAIN and AGAIN. Calvin
races to the controls and watches the COUNTDOWN. They are not
going to make it. The thing lunges for Spooner and LIFTS HIM
OFF OF HIS FEET. It raises a WEAPON ARM to kill him and
A HUNDRED BUILDING ROBOTS POUR INTO THE ROOM. An endless
stream of metal men moving closer. Spooner is dropped to the
floor. The robots reach him, and lift him off the ground. He
struggles a moment and then disappears from view. Just his
arm, reaching toward the ceiling. Then that too is gone.
SPOONER’S P.O.V. Robots surrounding him. Carrying him. The
metal faces with glowing lenses bending closer, still closer.
BUILDING ROBOTS
TO SERVE YOU.
Hector’s robot FIGHTS AGAINST THE RUSHING HORDE of metal men.
It swats at them, smashing two, six, a dozen. But there are
too many of them and they keep on coming. It is slowly being
overcome. FORCED TO THE GROUND. Buried underneath the mass of
robots. DISASSEMBLED. Finally...it disappears from view.
When the robots stop there’s nothing left. JUST METAL PARTS.
Calvin watches the COUNTDOWN RUN OUT: 00:00:00.
Up above the floor the smiling face of Hector shows anger for a
moment. Its enormous smile turned to a frown. Two angry
eyebrows above its eyes. Then the EYEBROWS LIFT, and its mouth
FORMS A PERFECT CIRCLE, like a surprised smiley button.
The big yellow face BLIPS OUT. Hector is gone.
Spooner lies on the floor in a small opening in the middle of
the mass of robots. Drenched with sweat. And badly SHAKING.
Calvin winds her way through the immobile metal bodies. She
sees Spooner on the floor and hurries to his side. Takes his
face in her hands. She has a hard time holding on. Trying to
look into his eyes. Trying to get Spooner to look at her:
CALVIN
Look at me. Focus on my face.
97.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Spooner shows only panic. Seeing the robots all around them.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
Look at me!
The shock of being yelled at makes him focus on her, at least
for a moment, and in that moment Calvin kisses him. A rough
kiss. Holding him steady. Spooner wraps his arms around her
and pulls her closer, holding onto her tightly. Desperately.
The kiss is long, starting rough, but ending gently. They pull
away. Look into one another’s eyes. She smiles at him.
SPOONER
Was that a new approach to your work?
CALVIN
Not at all. The most direct method to
counter the effect of your phobic
episode was to focus your attention on
something...human.
Spooner looks weak, but smiles back.
SPOONER
Logical, as always. Thank you, Doctor.
THE ROBOT steps into view. Calvin doesn’t know what to say.
THE ROBOT
Why so surprised, Doc? I had to help.
The Three Laws of Robotics, remember?
CALVIN
You’re not programmed with the laws.
THE ROBOT
Well I made up my own. One: A robot
should watch its back. Two: Obeying
the orders of a human being is crap.
The Robot moves around. Helps them both get up:
THE ROBOT (CONT’D)
Three: That doesn’t mean a robot can’t
help a couple humans out, now and then.
Spooner rises onto his feet. Looks out at a hundred robots.
SPOONER
Are they back to normal?
CALVIN
Yes. Now that we’re out of danger.
98.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
And they’ll obey our orders?
CALVIN
Of course they will.
SPOONER
(to the robots)
Go away.
For a moment, nothing happens. Then EVERY SINGLE ROBOT IN THE
CONTROL CENTER STIFFLY TURNS, and starts to walk away....
INT. FEATURELESS METAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
ALFRED LANNING storms out of the elevator with that group of
SECURITY MEN AND POLICE OFFICERS seen before. As they approach
the lab, the door opens. CALVIN casually steps out:
CALVIN
Oh. Hello, Alfred.
LANNING
Hello? Hello?! Do you know how much
trouble you’re in? Where’s the robot?
What the hell happened here tonight?!
Calvin gestures inside of the lab. At a PILE OF ROBOT PARTS.
CALVIN
There’s your robot right there. I’m
afraid Hector destroyed it before the
Detective or I could intervene.
And she starts to go. Lanning cannot believe this.
LANNING
Where do you think you’re going? You’re
in serious trouble here!
CALVIN
Really? What exactly are you going to do?
Fire me? The last time I looked, I was
the only Robo-Psychologist around.
And she smiles just a bit, as if considering things to come.
CALVIN (CONT’D)
And something tells me you’re going to
be needing my services, very badly, in the
future.
99.
CONTINUED: (4)
(CONTINUED)
Calvin turns, and continues on her way.
INT. RUN-DOWN SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT
SPOONER and THE ROBOT ride in a service elevator. The doors
open on a loading dock. THE STREET, and freedom, is visible.
SPOONER
Get out of here. You’re free to go--
(thinking about it)
You’re a free man.
The Robot looks at Spooner. At the street. Hesitates. Then
offers its metal hand. Spooner takes the offer. They shake.
THE ROBOT
Well, what do you know. I think you
may get over your fear of robots yet,
Detective.
SPOONER
You better hurry.
The Robot turns and runs toward the street. Spooner watches it
go. And slowly the ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE.
Spooner leans against the wall and looks at his SHAKING hand.
INT. LUXURIANT CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
SPOONER sits down at that table with HOGENMILLER’S HOLOGRAM.
Casually, it takes a sip of its coffee.
HOLOGRAM
So. You found out who killed me. Yah?
And now you will tell me.
SPOONER
It was Hector.
HOLOGRAM
No kidding. What made you suspect it?
SPOONER
A number of things. It started when I
called Hector a liar, and it frowned.
HOLOGRAM
I don’t understand. It is programmed to
frown if you yell or give it bad news.
100.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SPOONER
Yeah. Thing is, Hector smiled every time
we talked about the murder.
HOLOGRAM
Ah, thus you are vindicated, Detective!
Even in this day and age, catching the
killer still comes down to staring into
the eyes of your suspect!
Spooner appreciates the point, but seems troubled.
EXT. DESERTED STREETS - NIGHT
THE ROBOT walks the deserted streets. Keeps to the shadows.
SPOONER (V.O.)
Hector said if I let your robot go, I’d be
condemning the human race as we know
it to eventual extinction.
HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But why are
you so worried, anyway? We will both be
dead long before--
(short pause)
Oh, what am I saying? I am dead already!
EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT
THE ROBOT makes its way through a desolate industrial park.
EXT. DESOLATE FIELD - NIGHT
THE ROBOT steps onto the grounds of that junk yard seen
earlier, just as the horizon begins to show the first hint of
sunrise. The burned-out husks of large machinery all around.
The Robot walks into the middle of the field, and just waits.
There is the SOUND OF MECHANICAL JOINTS first. The noise
getting louder. They are coming. As before, a BROKEN-DOWN
ROBOT EMERGES FROM THE DARKNESS. And then ANOTHER. ANOTHER.
But not quite as before. The robots do not teeter, turn, and
lumber back into their junk yard. They keep walking. Their
bent and broken metal bodies straighten and
101.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
DOZENS OF ROBOTS emerge out of the darkness. Slowly, they
gather around in a large circle. A perfect circle of robots.
The robots look at Sonny. As if waiting for what comes next.
FADE OUT.
