X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) 



FADE IN: EXT. MOSCOW - FUTURE - DAY11*We soar over the skyline. Buildings have been destroyed. Windows shattered. Streets deserted. We land on--EXT. RED SQUARE - FUTURE - DAY22MILITARY TRUCKS roll into the middle of the square. Empty, ghostly. Pigeons flap, the only signs of life. SUPER:
The not too distant future...
SOLDIERS climb out of the trucks. They have insignias on their uniforms, an icon that will become familiar. They open the back doors of a truck. We PUSH INTO THE BACK. *Dark, quiet. Shadows shift, and we hear-- A MECHANICAL HUM coming to life. As it rises, we CUT TO--EXT. KREMLIN PALACE - FUTURE - DAY33This sprawling site was once the center of a superpower. Now it is abandoned. We push toward it, and--DROP DOWN DOWN DOWN A HUNDRED FEET UNDERGROUND TO--INT. KREMLIN PALACE - UNDERGROUND HALL - FUTURE - DAY44Two young REFUGEES stand guard. One of them, JAMES “WARPATH” *PROUDSTAR, cocks his head. His ears perk up, he has SUPER *HEARING. He hears the distant sound of the HUM.He turns to a young woman named BLINK. WARPATHThey’re here.Blink grabs him and WHHM! They DISAPPEAR, TELEPORTING INTO--INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - FUTURE - DAY55A vast BOMB SHELTER under the Kremlin. Shelves are full of food, the floor full of bunks, all inhabited by--*A BAND OF MUTANT REFUGEES. By the piles of empty cans, it’s *clear they’ve been here for a while.WHHM! Blink and Warpath APPEAR in the middle of the room.

BLINK55They found us. As the mutants snap into defensive positions, we see a familiar face in the crowd:KITTY PRYDE. She looks toward a large mutant with an “M” brand over his eye. This is BISHOP. He moves toward her, starts leading her deeper into the bunker, as--*The rest of the mutants look up to see: the ceiling TREMBLES. Then CRACKS, spiderwebs getting wider and wider, and--*A LARGE BLACK DRILL comes through the ceiling. We hear the MECHANICAL HUM getting louder, as the drill TRANSFORMS into- A MASSIVE HAND. *The arm and body follow, dropping through the ceiling, *landing in the center of the room, revealing--A TWELVE FOOT TALL CREATURE. Black scales. Yellow eyes. It looks like a biomechanical version of MYSTIQUE. This is--THE SENTINEL OF THE FUTURE. The largest mutant soldier steps up, his skin turns to STEEL. *This is PETER “COLOSSUS” RASPUTIN. He tries to fight the *Sentinel, but--*The Sentinel TRANSFORMS, its long arms turn into STEEL like *Colossus, grabbing him, HAMMERING him with a massive steel *fist. As Colossus falls--*Two more Sentinels drop into the room.*The MUTANTS OPEN FIRE with various powers, but--*THE SENTINELS MOVE AND MORPH LIKE MYSTIQUE, TWISTING IN THE AIR, DODGING EVERY SHOT, FLYING OVERHEAD, CHASING AFTER--KITTY AND BISHOP, who work their way through the action, *racing toward a HUGE VAULT DOOR. Kitty looks back to see--THE SENTINELS DECIMATING THE MUTANTS. *JUBILEE fires SPARKS at a Sentinel, but it absorbs her *energy, and FIRES BACK, killing her. BLINK teleports around one of the Sentinels, trying to grab it, but WHAM! She FREEZES, eyes wide. She looks down, sees: The Sentinel’s ARM has transformed into a long BLADE, IMPALING her stomach. Blink FLICKERS, then drops, dead.2.

 
PROUDSTAR goes down. Others drop. The Sentinels take out *three at a time, charging toward--*Kitty and Bishop. They reach the vault door where--55BOBBY “ICEMAN” DRAKE stands guard. As Kitty passes Bobby, their eyes meet for a moment, a bond between them, and--WHHM. Kitty grabs Bishop, PHASING THROUGH THE DOOR. Bobby fires BLASTS OF ICE back at the Sentinels, who plow through the last line of mutants. Bobby keeps firing, but--The Sentinels HEAT UP, MELTING the ice, swarming Bobby, *KILLING him. He drops with a thud, a pool of water and blood *around him, and just like that--*The room is silent. The floor littered with bodies.A mutant massacre. The Sentinels face the huge vault door. They HEAT UP, their bodies GLOWING. One of them puts a hand to the door, MELTING THE STEEL, creating a hole the size of its head.The Sentinel pushes its head through the opening, then SQUEEZES ITS WHOLE BODY THROUGH THE HOLE, slithering into--INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - VAULT ROOM - FUTURE - DAY66The Sentinel enters the vault to see--*BISHOP laying on a bed. KITTY sits beside him, her hands on his temples. He looks like he’s in some kind of trance. KITTYToo late, guys.THE SENTINEL FLIES AT KITTY AND BISHOP, BUT RIGHT AS IT HITS--*WHHHHHM.THEY DISAPPEAR. Kitty, Bishop, the Sentinel. All of them are *suddenly GONE. We PULL BACK through the door into--INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - MAIN ROOM77THE MAIN ROOM where the mutants were slaughtered.Only now, the bodies are gone. The beds are made. The canned food is back on shelves. As if they were never here.3.

 
Off this strange sight, we--*FADE OUT. 
X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST
*The black screen shimmers, becoming the blue waters of--77*EXT. NEW YORK CITY - FUTURE - DAWN 88A sun rises over the river. Buildings are blown out, a couple bridges collapsed. We see a sign that reads: RESTRICTED AREA, NO MUTANTS. EXT. LONDON - FUTURE - DAY99The streets are empty here too. In the distance, we see Big Ben, the hands frozen, the face cracked. Military trucks (like the ones in Moscow) patrol the streets. And we continue around a war-torn world: EXT. PARIS - FUTURE - DUSK 1010*The city is flooded. We glimpse more SIGNS in French, WARNINGS AGAINST MUTANTS. A chunk of the Eiffel Tower is gone. High atop the tower: a few SENTINELS are perched.EXT. GREAT WALL OF CHINA - FUTURE - NIGHT 1111The Great Wall is damaged, defaced, like the rest of the  world. SENTINELS stand guard. They don’t notice something high overhead, a little dot in the sky. *We MOVE CLOSER to the reveal: it is a DARK STEALTH JET. *The new X-JET. *INT. X-JET - FUTURE - NIGHT*Hologram-displays flicker in the cockpit. We see a familiar *face flying the plane: *ORORO “STORM” MUNROE. We PUSH into the back of the chair *beside her--*A device is built into the chair that wraps around a BALD *HEAD. We get a glimpse of his reflection in the cockpit: *PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER. We see a couple more reflections *behind him, two silhouettes looming in the back of the plane.


XAVIER*Take us down, Storm. I think we’ve *found them...*EXT. MONGOLIAN MOUNTAINS - FUTURE - NIGHT1212*The highest peak is wreathed in clouds. The X-Jet lands. The *door slowly opens. Storm steps down. She looks out, her eyes *go white, and the CLOUDS CLEAR, revealing they are in--AN ANCIENT MONASTERY built into the side of the mountain. *Behind her, a WHEELCHAIR hovers down. Xavier joins her. Then *the last two members of the crew:*ERIK “MAGNETO” LENSHERR. And LOGAN, aka WOLVERINE. *The four of them stand side by side, looking up at this *ancient fortress. They take a few steps forward, but--Xavier slows, tense. XAVIER1212We’re surrounded.And now we see: MUTANTS HIDING behind walls and columns. The faces are familiar from the opening action. Alive again.MAGNETOLet’s see if there’s any metal in the group...Magneto raises a hand, and...ALL OF THE METAL starts to SHAKE on the mutants, RATTLING, revealing them. WHHM! BLINK appears right behind Magneto with a sharp stick *pressed firmly to his neck. SNNKT! Logan snaps out a CLAW.*XAVIERI think enough mutant blood has *been spilled already. BISHOP (O.S.)We’ll be the judge of that.BISHOP steps out. The rest of the mutants emerge around him.*BLINK*You could’ve led the Sentinels here *in that thing.*She motions toward the X-Jet. *5.

 
XAVIER*The jet is made with a stealth *technology, impossible to detect.*PROUDSTAR*Not impossible.*He detected them. Bishop steps closer. *BISHOP*I know who you are. I’ve heard *about you. The “X-Men.” *He gives a little chuckle, looks to Xavier and Magneto.*BISHOP (CONT’D)From what I heard, you two weren’t *exactly on the same side. LOGAN *We’re all on the same side now.He retracts his claw. And they hear a familiar voice:*BOBBY*Professor. Storm. *They turn, see BOBBY approaching. *STORM*Bobby. *KITTY is with him. Xavier slows, focuses on her. *XAVIER*Kitty...*He reads her mind, realizing--*XAVIER (CONT’D)*(softly)*It’s true. *EXT. MONASTERY - COLONNADE - FUTURE - NIGHT1313*The group now sits together. Some eating, Blink sharpening *her stick. But all of them listening. *KITTY*Whenever the Sentinels attack, I *send Bishop back a week--*6.

 
BISHOP*I warn them. Blink spots the next *site, and we pack up and go before *the Sentinels ever get close.*Xavier, Magneto, Logan, and Storm look impressed.*LOGAN*You’re dragging people through more *than walls, huh kid?*Kitty shakes her head. *KITTY*Not them physically. Just their * mind. *She looks at Charles, who understands--*XAVIER*She projects the subatomic part of *the brain -- the impulses -- the *thing we call consciousness -- into *the person’s younger self. *MAGNETO*Ah, to be young again.*(a smile)*This just might work, Charles. *KITTY1313*What might work? What’s he talking about, Professor...? Xavier looks at Kitty, takes a breath. *XAVIER*The Sentinel Program was created by Dr. Bolivar Trask.*BISHOPEveryone knows who started the Sentinels.*XAVIERBut not everyone knows how it started. In 1973, at the Paris *Peace Accords, a meeting between *Trask and his associates was infiltrated by a mutant...a mutant  with the ability to transform herself into anything... 


KITTY Mystique...Xavier nods. XAVIERShe was captured that day. Taken to a lab where they used her DNA to develop the mutating transforming  weapons that have killed so many of our kind. Kitty looks at Xavier, confused. KITTYWhat do you want me to do about it? *XAVIERWe want you to send someone back to *that day in 1973, so we can stop her, keep her out of their hands, keep the Sentinels from ever being born. MAGNETOAnd end this war before it ever begins. Kitty looks at Magneto, Xavier. KITTYI can send someone back a week, for 1414*a few hours. You’re talking about *decades for days. *STORM *It’s the same basic principle--*KITTYNo, it’s not. Going through time is *like going through a black hole, the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps. That kind of break  would rip your brain apart, you’d *be dead inside of seconds. *The words hang there. KITTY (CONT’D)I’m sorry, I wish I could help, but you’re asking the impossible. Nobody could survive that trip. 8.

 
Xavier doesn’t have a response. Magneto and Storm look *devastated, the reality hitting them, but...*LOGANWhat if someone’s mind had a way of snapping back...?They all turn to Logan.LOGAN (CONT’D)What if someone could heal as fast *as they get rip apart...?*Kitty considers. Bishop steps up. BISHOP It’s a risk.*LOGAN*Yeah, I’m getting that.*BISHOP*Not just for you. For all of us. *You mess with time and space like that, start opening holes, you don’t know what’s gonna come through. And you’ll be changing over fifty years of history. Some *of us could be killed, some of us could never be born...He steps closer to Logan, his eyes intense.BISHOP (CONT’D)And for the traveler, there’s 1414another burden. You’ll be the only one who remembers this world, this  war, you’ll carry that with you. *And that’s all you’ll remember. *Whatever becomes of history, you’ll  wake up and it’ll be like half your *life is just...blank. Gone. *They all look at Logan. The weight of that. He shrugs.LOGANWell...wouldn’t be the first time. Kitty looks around the room.KITTYWe need to vote.*Xavier reads everyone’s minds with a glance.*9.

 
XAVIERYou just did. They’re in. *As Kitty looks back at Logan, we CUT TO--INT. MONASTERY - INNER SANCTUM - FUTURE - DAY1515*An ancient sanctuary. Kitty leads them into the room. LOGANSo how does this work exactly? KITTYYou’ll go into a restive state  while your consciousness transfers back to your body in 1973.LOGAN Won’t be much of an adjustment. KITTYAs long as you’re back there, the connection stays open, and history stays open with it--LOGANMeaning?KITTYPast and present will continue to 1515co-exist. But once you wake,  whatever you’ve done to the past  will take hold and become history.Xavier notices Magneto hanging back, stepping out of the *room. Xavier goes after him.*EXT. MONASTERY - FUTURE - DAWN*Magneto stands alone, looks out at the rising sun. Xavier *approaches. *MAGNETO*This war brought us back together. *Xavier slows, softens. *XAVIER*I’d like to think we’d have come to *our senses without it. *MAGNETO*I’ve been many things, Charles, but *“sensible” is not one of them.

Xavier moves closer to Magneto. *XAVIER*We’ve had our differences. But our *friendship always won out. It will *again. No matter what history may *bring. *Magneto looks over at his oldest friend, always the source of *his hope, comfort. He smiles softly. *MAGNETO*I guess we’ll find out...*INT. MONASTERY - INNER SANCTUM - FUTURE - DAY*Xavier and Magneto return, as Logan lays on a stone slab in *the middle of the room. Kitty is preparing herself. *LOGAN*How long will I have back there?*KITTYI’ve never sent anyone back this far, I’ll hold on long as I can--BISHOPOr until the Sentinels find us.*Logan looks at them. *LOGAN*Great. Any good news? A beat. None. BISHOP Your mutton chops will be back in 1515style. Logan glares at him. *KITTY*Okay Logan, clear your thoughts. *Everyone else, back away. I need *him calm, focused. *They all step away. Magneto and Xavier watch from the corner.*MAGNETOYou really think this will work...?*Xavier motions to Logan.11.

 
XAVIERI have faith in him. MAGNETOIt’s not him I’m worried about. It’s us. We were young, foolish. We didn’t know any better...Xavier nods, but...XAVIERWe will now.They look over at Logan. Kitty puts her hands on his temples.KITTYThis might sting a little... Kitty’s power swirls around Logan, gripping him, and--LOGAN’S BODY GOES RIGID, HE GIVES A DEAFENING SCREAM AND--WHHHHHHM. His screams go silent. His eyes slowly open. He is laying in--1515INT. NEW YORK HOTEL ROOM - PAST - MORNING 1616Logan is now staring at a dirty ceiling. He winces, as if  waking from a nightmare. He looks down at his body, wearing different clothes. A tank top, little else. And he sees: There is a WOMAN in bed with him. A beautiful if slightly trashy blonde. An old classic ROCK SONG plays on the radio. Logan rises from the bed. He stumbles to the dresser, grabs a *bottle of booze, knocks back a swig. He finds his way to the * window, opens the curtain, winces in sunlight, and sees--*NEW YORK CITY. Cars, clothes, signs from...1973. *LOGAN*It worked. Holy shit it--*BANG! A door crashes open. Logan spins to see--Three MAFIA HOODS barge into the room, waking the girl in bed. They look at her.HOOD #1 Put some clothes on.They have GUNS in hand. 12.

 
LOGANLook, I don’t know what’s going on here, but--HOOD #1What’s going on is you slept with the bosses daughter when you were supposed to be her bodyguard. Logan shakes his head. LOGANI didn’t sleep with her. HOOD #2No?LOGANNo. I mean yes I slept with her, but that wasn’t me, that was the old me, I just got here ten seconds ago. HOOD #1Really? Then what happened to your pants? Logan looks down, indeed he is not wearing pants. He 1616considers. No easy explanation. LOGANWould you believe me if I told you I was sent here from the future...?The hoods darken, the answer is no.HOOD #1(to girl)Get out of here, sweetheart. We’re gonna take care of this comedian. Logan shakes his head. LOGANNo you’re not. You’re going to give  me the keys to your car and some  money for gas, or you’re going to  wake up in the hospital. Trust me, I know how this plays out.HOOD #1Because you’re from the future?
 
LOGANNo. Because of this.SNIKT SNIKT! His CLAWS come out, but--THEY ARE BONE CLAWS. He looks at them for a second, a little surprised. But not as surprised as the thugs.HOOD #3What the hell--Terrified, the men OPEN FIRE. The girl SCREAMS, scrambling out of the room. A couple shots HIT Logan, but barely slow him, his wounds HEALING as their eyes go wide and--Logan KNOCKS the thugs back, keeps coming, finishing them *off. As the last one falls, FIRING--*Logan DODGES the shot and SLICES the guy’s pocket, so his KEYS come flying out, and Logan catches them in the air.He has the keys dangling around a claw. His claws slowly RETRACT, the keys slide into his hand, and he looks at them: *A furry RABBIT’S FOOT at the end. *EXT. NEW YORK STREET - PAST - DAY *Logan emerges, wearing a thug’s leather jacket. He looks *around the street, sees--*People dressed in period clothes. A phone booth. The tips of *the Twin Tower in the distance. And he sees--*A big CADILLAC parked across the street, dice dangling from *the mirror, the license plate reads: “LUCKY.” Logan shakes *his head, knows this is his ride. *EXT/INT. CADILLAC - PAST - DAY *Logan gets in the car. He slides the keys into the ignition, *the engine growls. As he pulls away, the RADIO plays--*RADIO VOICE (V.O.)1717...the 18th MP Brigade is departing from Saigon, marking the last American troops to leave Vietnam, effectively ending the war...EXT. US CAPITOL BUILDING - PAST - DAY1818American flags flap outside Congress.14.

 
RADIO VOICE (V.O.)...the Peace Treaty will be signed in Paris in two days... *INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - PAST - DAY1919A sign reads: CLOSED SESSION. Inside the hall, a CONGRESSIONAL PANEL faces one man at a table: DR. BOLIVAR TRASK, sharp eyes, hard gaze, a man ahead of his time. SENATOR...in light of the times, we are reviewing all defense expenditures, every black book’s getting opened, and frankly we don’t see a need for your program, Dr. Trask. SENATOR 2As far as we can tell, these “mutants” you describe, if they are living among us, are living peacefully. TRASKFor now. SENATOR We haven’t had an incident in over ten years. We’re talking about a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of the population--TRASKThat could rise up at any time against the rest of us. But don’t *take my word for it. Take theirs. *He pulls out a thick report.TRASK (CONT’D)This was acquired by our friends at the CIA. It’s a dissertation  written by a mutant at Oxford University. Allow me to read you a couple lines about the last time we experienced a leap in evolution...As he opens the report, we see the author on the title page: 1919CHARLES XAVIER. Trask reads--TRASK (CONT’D)“To Homo Neanderthalensis, his  mutant cousin Homo Sapiens was an aberration. 15.(MORE)

 
Peaceful cohabitation, if ever it existed, was short-lived, followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin.”He shuts the report. TRASK (CONT’D)We are the Neanderthals now.SENATORSpeak for yourself, Dr. Trask. The Senators laugh. Trask looks at them, a beat. *TRASKYou know, when I was growing up, I  wasn’t as strong as the other kids. They could run faster, throw a ball further. They thought they would always be superior. They had the sunny confidence, the arrogance, that comes from ignorance. He eyes the Senators, who start to sober. *TRASK (CONT’D)I suspect you had some of the same  when you sent our soldiers into Vietnam without the weapons they needed to win the war. You under-estimated your enemy. If you do that with this enemy...(motions to the file)...it won’t be some border skirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will be for our cities, our streets, our homes. And by the time you see the “need” for  my program, it will be too late, gentlemen, and you will have lost two wars in one lifetime. The Senators look around, nobody laughing now. As Trask 1919*commands the room, we CUT TO--*EXT. SAIGON - US ARMY BASE - PAST - DAY2020Rain pounds down. AMERICAN SOLDIERS are being transferred home. They look weary, defeated, loading onto planes. In the sea of soldiers, we find: A YOUNG PRIVATE. He moves *toward a HIGH-SECURITY BUILDING. He flashes credentials to *the MPS at the door, and enters--
 
INT. HIGH SECURITY BUILDING - PAST - DAY

121The Private moves down a hall to a DOOR where a HEAVILY ARMED *GUARD stands. The word “QUARANTINE” on the door. *GUARDYou the one come to collect these freaks? The Private nods.GUARD (CONT’D)Good, just having them here gives  me the heebie-jeebies. The Private pushes through the door into--INT. HIGH SECURITY BUILDING - MAIN AREA - PAST - DAY2222A dark lab where a handful of MUTANT SOLDIERS are being held. One of them has green skin like a TOAD. *ARMY DOCTORS run tests, wearing surgical masks. The Private *looks around, his eyes wide, seeing--Work stations with medical reports, vials of blood. He passes *a DOCTOR, his voice low--*PRIVATE *What is all this? *DOCTOR*Lab reports. Blood tests.*The Private looks at the intricate reports.*PRIVATE*Where’s it all going? *DOCTOR*Same place they are. *He motions to the mutants. The Private sees a FILE with an *insignia on it, the same insignia for the guns in the future--*PRIVATE*(reading)*Trask Industries. What’s that...?*The Doctor looks at him, sensing something off about this *guy, as--*The doors swing open. Four SOLDIERS enter, they have that *same INSIGNIA on their sleeves. They work for Trask. *17.
 
The leader is a sharp faced CAPTAIN named BILL. He nods to *the doctors, who file out. Then he turns to the mutants. *BILL*Let’s go, on your feet, we’re *taking you out of here. *The mutant soldiers look happy, relieved. We see a familiar *face among them: ALEX “HAVOC” SUMMERS. He steps up. *ALEX*We’re shipping home? *BILL*You’re being transferred to another *base. A secure facility where we *can run a few more tests. *Alex and the other mutants darken, disappointed. *PRIVATE*No, actually, they’re going home. *Bill and his men turn to the YOUNG PRIVATE. *BILL*I’m sorry, Private, did you say *something? *PRIVATE*I said they’re not going to another *lab. They’re going home, sir. *Real tension in the air now. *BILL *Is that right? On whose order...? *The Private steps toward Bill.2222*PRIVATEOn yours. *With that, the Private TRANSFORMS INTO BILL. There’s only one *person in the world with this power:RAVEN. *Everyone stands shocked for a moment. Then Bill reaches for *his gun, but she LEAPS AT HIM. They spin, struggle. The other soldiers raise guns, but--They don’t know which Captain is real. 18.

 
Raven uses his body for a SHIELD as she ATTACKS the troops, a *blinding whirl of motion, a hardened assassin.She finally KNOCKS DOWN Bill with the butt of his own gun. He *stirs, reaches for another weapon, but--*Raven transforms and KNOCKS HIM OUT with a BLUE FOOT to the *face. She stands over him, completely blue now. *ALEXRaven. *RAVENThat’s not my name. (to mutants)*Let’s go, move out. Security will be here in seconds. She passes a work station, grabs a file. *ALEXI thought you were working with *Erik. RAVENErik’s gone, they got him. I’m on * my own. *(to the mutants)*I said LET’S MOVE. As they move toward a back door, Bill stirs, semi-conscious. *He pulls his weapon, a prototype from TRASK INDUSTRIES. *He aims it at the departing troops. Alex is last in line. *Alex slows as he hears the weapon WHIR to life. Alex turns, *starts to generate his FORCE-BLAST, but--*WHHHM. Bill FIRES first, the gun shoots a TASER-LIKE CHARGE *that shorts out Alex’s power. Alex drops, his body spasming. *Bill starts to power up to fire again, as--*The far doors swing open, MPs charging in. Alex has just *enough power to look at Raven and say: *ALEX*Go. *Raven has no choice. She leaves him, lunging out the door * with the rest of the mutants, as--*MPs swarm Alex in the room, grabbing him.

 
EXT. MILITARY BASE TARMAC - DAY

424*An MP (Raven) leads the troops across the tarmac. Behind *them, MPs are searching the base, locking it down. *MP/RAVEN*Keep moving, head down, keep * walking.*She leads them toward a TRANSPORT CHOPPER which is starting *to seal up. They pass a COLONEL, keep going and--RAVEN TURNS INTO THE COLONEL, calling out to the chopper--*COLONELHold that door!The doors stay open. Soldiers salute the Colonel. COLONEL (CONT’D)Wouldn’t want to leave these poor boys in this godforsaken country. They load the mutants into the chopper. *TOADYou’re not coming with us?He looks at the Colonel. COLONELMy war’s not over. 2424The Colonel walks away. As the chopper shuts behind him, we *see his face TRANSFORM into--RAVEN. An Army Nurse. For the first time, we see her human *face, the rain falling on her. *As she keeps moving, she looks down at the scrap of paper from the lab, the insignia and address for: *TRASK INDUSTRIES. *She disappears into the rain, one step closer to her destiny, *and we CUT TO--*EXT. XAVIER MANSION - 1973 - PAST - DAY 2525The familiar mansion. A car comes up the driveway, Logan at the wheel. He looks out, notices the garden is dead, weeds growing. A sign reads: PRIVATE PROPERTY, KEEP OUT. 20.
 
And we see a faint outline where another sign once stood. The sign for Xavier’s school. Now gone. Logan pulls up to the front of the house. He gets out, looks around. Silent. Empty. He walks up to--The front door. He rings the bell. He hears it chime off-key, like it hasn’t been rung in years. He goes to a window, thick with dust. He wipes it clear to *get a look inside: minimal furniture, no signs of life. His *eyes narrow, sniffing the air, and--VOICE (O.S.)*Can I help you? Logan turns to see: YOUNG HANK MCCOY in the doorway. LOGANYeah, what happened to the school?HANKThe school has been shut for years. Were you a parent? Logan just looks at him. LOGANNo. Who are you? HANKI’m Hank, Hank McCoy. I look after 2626the house now.LOGANYou’re...Beast? Guess you’re a late bloomer. Hank tenses. He hasn’t heard that name in years. HANKI don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’m going to have to ask you to leave. He starts to close the door, but Logan STOPS it. They hold the door from opposite sides, muscles tense. LOGANPretty strong for a scrawny little kid. You sure there’s not a little Beast in there...? We see something FLICKER in Hank’s eyes as he strains.21.
 
HANKPlease...just....go.... Hank’s grip tightens, his hand looks like it might be SHIFTING slightly, skin rippling. LOGANNot till I see the Professor. HANKThere’s no...Professor...here.LOGANWe’ll see about that. WHHHM. Logan pushes the door open and blows past Hank into--INT. XAVIER MANSION - FRONT HALL - PAST - DAY2727Logan gets a few steps into the house but--A hand grabs him from behind. Not a hand. A BLUE PAW. HANKI told you to LEAVE!On the last word, Hank GROWLS. Logan turns and sees--Hank transforming into the big, blue, furry BEAST. LOGANThere he is. 2727Hank LEAPS at Logan. Logan ducks it, and HURLS Hank into a  wall. Logan heads up the stairs, but--Hank gives chase. He CLIMBS quickly up the banister, faster,  more agile now. He LEAPS at Logan, SLAMMING into him.They collide, crashing through the hall, two powerful animals locked in a brawl until--WHAM! Hank KNOCKS Logan back through the banister to--THE FRONT HALL. They hit the ground hard, Hank on top of Logan. Hank reels back his paw for a final blow and--CHARLES (O.S.)HANK?! What’s going on?Hank lowers his fist. Logan looks up to see-- A shadow at the top of the stairs. Logan realizes it is:

LOGANProfessor...? It is CHARLES XAVIER. But he doesn’t look anything like the  man we knew. His hair is longer, eyes wilder, no shoes. *CHARLES Nobody calls me that. Logan stares at him, processing--*LOGANCharles... *HANK*You know this guy? *Charles looks down at him with dim recognition. CHARLESWe met. *LOGANLong time ago. I was...a different * man then. CHARLESYeah well, so was I. And Charles starts to WALK DOWN THE STAIRS. Logan is stunned. LOGANI thought Erik...put you in the *chair...*Charles tenses, keeps coming.*LOGAN (CONT’D)*...but you can walk. *CHARLES*You are perceptive. Which makes it 2727all the more puzzling that you failed to see the sign on your way in: this is private property. So I’m going to tell you what you told  me when we first met...(eyes level)Fuck off, mate. LOGANI’m afraid I can’t do that. I was sent here for you.23.

 
CHARLESWell tell whoever sent you that I’m not interested. LOGANThat’s gonna be a little tricky, seeing as the person that sent me  was you... About fifty years from *now. Charles looks at Logan. So does Hank. CHARLESI sent you here...from the future.HANKHe’s crazy. *Logan steps toward Charles. *LOGANYou don’t believe me? Take a look. See for yourself. *(motions to his mind)In about fifty years, the humans *create a weapon that wipes us out. *Mutants, humans, anything that gets *in its way. Whole cities will be *destroyed. Everything you fought *for, everything you will fight for...is gone. Charles sees dim flickers of what Logan describes: cities *burning, rows of graves. Charles steps back, reeling. *CHARLESHe’s not crazy, Hank. *(darker, broken)*I was the crazy one...for thinking *I could change them.*He starts to walk away, defeated. *LOGANRaven’s the first casualty. 2727The name slows Charles.

Charles injects the serum into his veins.HANK (V.O.)He takes it every day, and every day I think maybe he’ll wake up and be himself again...Charles puts the serum back in the drawer. HANK (V.O.)But that day never comes. Charles slows when he sees a photo in the drawer, peeking out from other photos and documents. He pulls it out:An old picture of himself with RAVEN. The two of them so young, so full of hope. He hears a faint echo:YOUNG CHARLES (V.O.)

HANKThe Pentagon was built in World War II when there was a shortage on steel, so the foundation is pure concrete and sand, no metal, the perfect place to hold him. *LOGANWhat’s he in jail for, this time?*CHARLES He didn’t tell you? Logan shakes his head. CHARLES (CONT’D)You may have heard about a “magic bullet” that killed a President in 1963.LOGANJFK...CHARLESWhat else would explain a bullet that curved in the air?

Wreckage. Erik looks to Charles, the guards unconscious around them. *ERIKNo killing. You have my word.*He heads for the elevator haft.

Erik looks at him, that strident tone. ERIKI can’t begin to imagine why she left.HANKShe left because you got in her head, messed with her mind.ERIKThat’s not my power, Hank.

He looks to Bill, who clicks a MICROFILM REEL into a projector, casting images onto a screen--TRASK (CONT’D)These are top secret files from the US Defense Department, evidence of a threat far deadlier than anything you’ve ever faced.

There’s no access past 7373this point. ERIK (FRENCH, SUBTITLED)Step away from the car please, and raise the barrier. The soldier steps closer, hand on his gun.SOLDIER (FRENCH, SUBTITLED)I’m not going to ask you again. ERIK (FRENCH, SUBTITLED)Nor am I. Now let us through. LOGANYou might want to do what he says.The soldiers look at each other, pulling guns.SOLDIERWhy would we do that? We have guns pointed at you.ERIKActually, you have guns pointed at each other. With that, Erik CONTROLS THE GUNS so they aim at one another. The triggers COCK, fingers tighten.CHARLESErik...ERIKI know the rules, Charles.WHAM! The guns WHIP UP, SMASHING into the soldiers’ faces, knocking them out. Erik moves the metal barrier with a wave of his hand, and they drive forward toward the hotel. INT.

RUSSIAN GENERALYou would betray your country by selling this weapon to us?*TRASKI’m a man of the world, General. 7474The world I see is not a world of *nations and borders, but a world of  man and mutant. And there’s only one way to retain our place atop that world...The image on the screen clicks to BLUEPRINTS for SENTINELS.TRASK (CONT’D)I call them Sentinels. Named for the ancient guardians who stood at the gates of the citadel. They have the aeronautic abilities of a Harrier Jet, and fire a particle-*beam that can burn through ten feet *of concrete. Their skin is *lightweight, made of the same *indestructible polymer that NASA uses for their space program, not *an ounce of metal in it...*The Generals look impressed. Trask continues--TRASK (CONT’D)But none of that is what makes the Sentinel so special. Size, power, speed, you can find that at Lockheed or Boeing. No, what makes the Sentinel so special is the ability to target the Mutant X gene. A genetic guidance system...He pulls out a small, handheld GUIDANCE SYSTEM.*TRASK (CONT’D)...that can lock onto a mark from half a mile away, and won’t trigger unless it identifies the target. So *there won’t be any human collateral damage, the system couldn’t even activate in here...But suddenly -- BEEP BEEP BEEP. The device is FLASHING. Trask slows, looks up. TRASK (CONT’D)......unless there was a mutant.54.

 
It targets: GENERAL LUONG. *As Trask steps toward him, the beeps get louder. General *Luong looks around, trapped.*GENERAL LUONG*There’s been some kind of mistake.*Trask glances at Bill, who pulls out that familiar TASER *WEAPON from Saigon. *TRASK*My machines don’t make mistakes...*The beeps turn into a flatline. *TRASK (CONT’D)*What are you...? *The General glances around, makes a decision, and--*TRANSFORMS INTO RAVEN. Blue scales, yellow eyes. *RAVEN*I’m the future. *She makes a move for Trask, but--*Bill FIRES his TASER. It hits Raven. She drops, losing *control of her body, FLUTTERING through identities, including *Trask. He gets closer, staring at her in awe.*TRASK*Amazing. You can mutate into *anyone...anything.*He gathers himself, look back at the Generals.*TRASK (CONT’D)*You see, gentlemen, this is *precisely what I’m talking about. *You never known when one of them is *in our midst...*He turns to Bill. *TRASK (CONT’D)*Take her away. She’ll make an *intriguing lab rat.*Bill and a few soldiers step toward her but--*VOICE (O.S.)*No she won’t.

They turn to see: *ERIK in the doorway. Flanked by Charles, Logan, and Hank. *RAVEN*Erik...*He steps into the room, looks to Raven, emotion in his eyes.*CHARLES *We came for you, Raven.*HANK*All of us. *Raven sees them together, manages a smile. Bill aims his *taser at them, soldiers pull guns, but--*All the weapons come FLYING OUT OF THEIR HANDS, hurled to the *other side of the room by Erik. All but one, which flies into-*HIS HAND. He raises it up. *ERIK*I’m sorry, Charles, but I’m going *to have to break my promise. *Charles looks at Erik. *CHARLES *Killing Trask isn’t the answer.*ERIK*I know. *And he lowers the gun, so he is aiming at...*RAVEN. *CHARLES*Erik, what, what are you doing?*ERIK*Securing our future. She’s the key *to our destruction. *Logan steps forward, everybody tensing. LOGANWhat the hell are you talking about?56.

Because that would give Trask exactly what he wants. And so will you, if you walk into his hands. He needs you, Raven, to seal our fate.
RAVEN *He can’t do that if he’s dead. *She TRANSFORMS into a DC POLICE OFFICER, crossing the 171171*barricade.CHARLES (V.O.)
Raven, stop now, or I will stop you.
She keeps moving, sliding out a GUN, almost there. CHARLES (V.O.)
Raven...
He focuses, ready to freeze her, but...His eyes flutter, sensing with dread--CHARLESSomething is happening...Logan hears something. He turns. Then everyone else hears it:A loud CRACKING sound. Like ice. Only it’s MARBLE. 99.

 
Heads turn toward the opposite side of the mall: EXT. THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL - PAST - DAY 172172The massive Lincoln statue is CRACKING, revealing the thin  metal skeleton under the stone. The metal twists and--THE STATUE RIPS OFF ITS BASE. It comes FLYING OUT OF THE MEMORIAL, shattering columns, tumbling across the REFLECTING POND--SMASHING INTO THE BASE OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT. The obelisk CRACKS, SPLITTING. It starts to tumble down, but--EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - PAST - DAY173173The top of the monument FREEZES in the air, the METAL CAP glistening in the sun. Charles goes cold. CHARLESErik...And now we see him: ERIK stands at the base of the Washington Monument, with one *arm controlling the tip of the monument, TURNING IT AROUND--SO IT FACES THE CAPITOL. HE HURLS IT TOWARD THE BUILDING. The crowd scatters, mass panic, as--174174The top of the Washington Monument comes CRASHING into the Capitol Building, destroying the dome.EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - PAST - DAY175175Secret Servicemen rush the President off the stage. SECRET SERVICEMAN*Sir, we need to get you to the *White House!*Trask looks to Bill in the chaos--TRASKActivate the Sentinels! Now!EXT. OTHER SIDE OF CAPITOL BUILDING - PAST - DAY*On the other side of the Capitol, we see the familiar CRATES, *guarded by SOLDIERS. The crates slide open, and--

EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - PAST - DAY*FIVE SENTINELS COME FLYING OVER THE CAPITOL. *The crowd looks up, seeing these massive machines: *EIGHTEEN FEET TALL. Polymer bodies. Deadly. *The SENTINELS fly toward Erik, but when they reach him, they *suddenly--FREEZE. Hovering around him. EXT. WASHINGTON DC NATIONAL MALL - PAST - DAY 177177Trask and Bill are rushing with the Secret Service toward the  motorcade, but Trask slows, confused.*TRASKWhat are they waiting for?! Why *aren’t they firing?!*BILL*They should have fired already! I don’t know what’s wrong!The Sentinels TURN OUTWARD, toward the crowd, the city. Erik gives a cold smile. *ERIKThey answer to a higher power now. He controls them.*Trask sees it, stunned. Charles, Logan, and Hank watch.CHARLESDon’t do this, Erik.But Erik can’t hear his voice. He controls a NEWS CAMERA, 177177 which floats toward him. He looks into the camera. ERIKI have a message for your President: these weapons you built to destroy us will bring about your *own destruction. Your monuments  will soon make way for ours. (a beat)We are the future now. Not you. 101.

 
With that, he controls the Sentinels in the sky, turning them *against the humans. As the crowd flees, the President and Trask are pushed into the motorcade, racing away. Charles looks up, as the Sentinels begin their attack on *Washington. And we CUT BACK TO-- *EXT. MONASTERY - WALLS - FUTURE - NIGHT179179Storm’s eyes are white, the wind blows, but--*The SENTINELS start to push through the hurricane, too strong *to stop. The mutants all brace for battle.*BISHOP*READY! HOLD THIS WALL!*The first line of Sentinels ATTACKS, clashing with the mutant *army as we CUT BACK TO--*EXT. DC NATIONAL MALL - PAST - DAY*The Sentinels attack the city, all orchestrated by Erik. *Logan and Hank move through the mayhem. Charles searches *faces and minds, but there’s too much chaos.*In the action, we see a couple familiar faces: *A few of the MUTANT SOLDIERS FROM SAIGON. They use their *powers against the Sentinels, try to help people. *As the attack continues, we INTERCUT--*THE MONASTERY IN THE FUTURE and NATIONAL MALL IN THE PAST.*Both under siege by a deadly pack of Sentinels. *Logan sees SHRAPNEL flying toward a pack of people. He steps *in the way, takes the shrapnel to his back, saving them. He * winces, healing, and he catches a glimpse of--*A SECRET SERVICEMAN rushing to a follow-vehicle for the *Presidential motorcade. The Serviceman has a familiar LIMP. He sees Logan through the crowd. Their eyes lock for a  moment, and the Serviceman’s eyes FLICKER YELLOW. It’s RAVEN.He leaps into the car with the other Serviceman, and they take off, trailing the motorcade toward the WHITE HOUSE. LOGANI got her! 102.

 
Logan makes his way back to Charles. Hank joins them. LOGAN (CONT’D)She’s in the President’s motorcade. 180180They’re heading to the White House.ACROSS THE MALL:*Erik sees the motorcade taking off. He gathers the Sentinels *into formation. He RISES UP, hovering between two Sentinels, *leading them toward the White House. *Logan, Charles, and Hank get into their car to give chase. *Logan leans on the horn, trying to clear the street. *As they trail Erik and Sentinels, we CUT TO--*EXT. MONASTERY - WALL - FUTURE - NIGHT*The mutant army keeps fighting the Sentinels, but--*The Sentinels are taking the upper hand. Jubilee is blasted *off the wall. Bishop FIRES his gun, but the Sentinel TWISTS *around the stream of energy, and BLOWS Bishop back.*Storm fights valiantly, she fires BLASTS OF LIGHTNING. She *hits one, two, three, but--*The fourth Sentinel gets her, KNOCKING her off the wall, *FALLING WITH HER, KILLING HER IN MID-FLIGHT and--*THUD. Storm lands hard. Her eyes wide, white, and...*Dead. The snow falls on her lifeless body. *INT. MONASTERY - INNER SANCTUM - FUTURE - NIGHT185185*Xavier darkens, feels Storm’s death. *XAVIER*Storm....*Magneto hears the name, knows what it means. He rises, heads *for the door, marching into battle, as we CUT BACK TO--*EXT/INT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY187187*Nixon, Trask, Bill and others are rushed into the OVAL *OFFICE. They roll back the rug, rip open a trapdoor in the *floor, heading down into an underground bunker. *Nixon pauses, goes to the desk to grab his famous TAPE-*RECORDER, taking it down with him.

As the second wave of Secret Servicemen arrive, we see--*RAVEN among them (disguised as her Secret Serviceman). She *slows for a moment, looks out the window to see--*EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*Erik lands on the White House lawn.*ERIK *Where are you...? *He raises a hand. *EXT. DC STREETS - PAST - DAY 183183*Logan’s car bears down on the White House. They see the *Sentinels spreading out to surround the house. *INT. WHITE HOUSE BUNKER - PAST - DAY*Nixon, Trask, and others are shuttled into the underground *nuclear bunker. The last man down is--*The familiar Secret Serviceman (Raven). He starts to make his * way toward Trask, but--*Suddenly, Trask hears something BEEP. He pulls out a familiar *device, the same TARGETING MECHANISM from Paris. It gets *louder as the Secret Serviceman gets closer. *TRASK*There’s one of them in here.*Bill turns, sees the Serviceman, and notices--*The man’s limp. Bill pulls out that TASER DEVICE. He is just *about to fire at Raven, she’s trapped, when suddenly--*THE BUNKER STARTS TO SHAKE. Then--*The taser and EVERYTHING METAL IS RIPPED UP TO THE CEILING. *All guns, clips, even Nixon’s tape recorder. *EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*Erik controls the metal bunker. He focuses, and start to RIP *THE METAL BUNKER OUT OF THE GROUND.*EXT/INT. DC STREET - PAST - DAY*Logan, Charles, and Hank hold tight as the ground shakes. *Cars SWERVE, CRASH. *104.
 
Logan SMASHES to a STOP, stuck in the pile-up, as-- *EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*The BUNKER comes SMASHING OUT OF THE GROUND, landing with *deafening impact at ERIK’S FEET. *EXT. WHITE HOUSE STREET - PAST - DAY*Logan, Charles, and Hank climb out of the car. They are *twenty feet away from the White House. They see--*The METAL BUNKER SITTING ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN. Erik stands *facing the bunker, wearing his helmet.*CHARLES*If you can get that helmet, I can *stop him.*Logan and Hank move quickly toward Erik. *EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*Erik RIPS the heavy metal door off the bunker. Nixon, Trask, *and the Secret Serviceman look out, seeing Erik.*NIXON*What do you want to stop this * madness...? *ERIK*There’s someone hiding among you...*All of the Sentinels shift their aim toward--*The familiar Secret Serviceman. He steps forward, and *TRANSFORMS INTO RAVEN. She stands defiantly. *RAVEN*I’m not hiding. *Erik looks at her, with emotion. *ERIK*I’m sorry, my dear, it’s not *personal. *Raven looks back at him.*RAVEN*It never was, was it? *The Sentinels raise their hands to fire, but--*105.
 
Raven’s eyes flick to the side. Erik follows them to see--*LOGAN AND HANK INCOMING. *Erik waves a hand, sends one of the Sentinels toward them. *ERIK*Do what you were made for.*As the Sentinel heads for Logan and Hank, we CUT BACK TO--*EXT. MONASTERY - COURTYARD - FUTURE - NIGHT*Magneto steps through the courtyard, sees dead bodies in the *snow. He looks up at the Sentinels breaching the wall. His *eyes shift around, searching for a weapon, and we CUT BACK TO-*EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*The Sentinel bears down on Logan and Hank. Hank makes a *decision, takes deep breaths to get his heart racing, and--*HE TRANSFORMS INTO BEAST. *HANK*I’ll keep it busy. You stop him. *Hank LEAPS UP, grabbing the Sentinel, FIGHTING IT. It FIRES *at Logan, BLASTING him, but Logan HEALS, keeps coming.*Erik raises a hand to stop him, but--*LOGAN*Left my dog-tags at home. *No metal on him. As Logan and Erik start to collide--*EXT. MONASTERY - COURTYARD - FUTURE - NIGHT*The Sentinels head toward Magneto, but he raises a hand, and--*HE LIFTS THE X-JET OFF THE GROUND. *EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*Hank fights the Sentinel, a brawl of beast and machine. *Logan SLAMS into Erik. They fight. The Sentinels dip around *them, one of them CRASHES to the lawn. *With Erik battling Logan, Raven turns back toward Trask. Bill * moves for his taser, but--

Raven moves faster, FLIPPING toward him, KICKING the taser *away. She keeps moving, scooping a gun off the ground, and--*She aims the gun at TRASK’S HEAD. She cocks the trigger and--*CHARLES (V.O.)*
Raven...
*He’s in her head. She pauses for a moment, and we CUT AROUND--*THE BATTLES IN PAST AND FUTURE.*EXT.

If you pull that trigger, you’re no
*
better than Erik.
*RAVEN*So why don’t you stop me? *CHARLES (V.O.)*
Because I believe in you, Raven. I
*
know who you are. Maybe you forgot,
*
but I remember...
*And her mind fills with the MEMORY that older Xavier gave to *his younger self. We see it flicker in Raven’s eyes. *She slows, seeing her younger self, the hope, light--*EXT. MONASTERY - FUTURE - NIGHT*Magneto swings the metal shards of the X-Jet at the *Sentinels, but there are too many of them, and not enough * metal. He starts to lose ground. *EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*Hank gets HIT by the massive hand of the Sentinel. He *struggles to stand. *107.
 
Logan knocks Erik down, reaches for his helmet, but--*Erik looks up, and sees something behind Logan: *The shattered SENTINEL, the METAL inside. And we see: *THE METAL FROM THE SENTINEL MELTS OUT...*SWIMMING ACROSS THE GROUND TO...LOGAN’S FEET.Logan gets his hands on Erik’s helmet, but he feels--*METAL GRABS HIS LEGS, snaking up his body to ENCASE HIS ARM. Logan tries to shake it off, but--IT PUNCTURES LOGAN’S SKIN, ENTERING HIS BODY. Logan HOWLS in agony. *FROM ACROSS THE LAWN: *Hank sees it. He goes FULL BEAST, more fierce and feral than *ever. He LEAPS UP at the Sentinel, and RIPS OFF ITS HEAD. *Then he LEAPS toward Erik, as--*Erik performs surgery on Logan, FILLING HIS BODY WITH METAL, *just like he did with the Sentinels. ERIKSo much for being a survivor. Erik sees Hank leaping at him. Raven sees it, the full Beast. *And right before he SLAMS into Erik--*Erik raises his other hand, and HURLS four sets of HANDCUFFS *at Hank, wrapping around his wrists and ankles, PULLING him *apart like a rack. He suffers, as--*Erik uses his other hand to LIFT LOGAN WITH THE METAL IN HIS *BODY. And Erik HURLS LOGAN THROUGH THE AIR. *EXT. MONASTERY - COURTYARD - FUTURE - NIGHT195195*Magneto struggles with the Sentinels. They KNOCK away the * metal parts. Then one of them HEATS UP, and--*BLASTS THE X-JET ENGINE.

EXT. MONASTERY - COURTYARD - FUTURE - NIGHT197197*Magneto hits the ground with bone-crushing impact. He tries *to rise, as the Sentinels swarm forward. *EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PAST - DAY*Erik focuses on Hank, hanging there with arms and legs drawn *apart by the cuffs. *ERIK*I’ll never understand it. You fight *for your own extinction. *Hank strains, pained, just able to say--*HNK*I’m...fighting...for...her.*The words resonate with Raven. She looks at Hank. She sees *Charles sitting helpless. She looks at the gun in her hand.*Erik starts to pull Hank apart, his blue flesh stretching. *ERIK*You think there’s a world where you *two could live the way you were * made? You think they’ll ever see *you as anything but a Beast...? *Hank can’t answer, too pained, dying. But they hear--*VOICE (O.S.)*Yeah, I do.*It’s RAVEN’S VOICE. *She’s right behind Erik. He turns as--*RAVEN RIPS HIS HELMET OFF HIS HEAD, EXPOSING HIM TO--*RAVEN*CHARLES!*Erik reaches for her throat but--Charles reaches out from the ground--*FREEZING ERIK.Hank drops, the cuffs fall lifeless, and--Charles focuses his power on Erik’s mind, using Erik to--

Erik has just enough power to speak-- *ERIKIf you let them...have me...I’m as good as dead. Charles nods, knows it’s true. He looks out and--FREEZES EVERYONE IN THE MALL. The soldiers, civilians. The entire mall is frozen around them. CHARLESUnlike you, I don’t kill my enemies.ERIKIs that what we are now? Enemies..? Charles looks at Erik, and UN-FREEZES him.

INT. HALLWAY - FUTURE - DAY221221*The hallway is instantly familiar. The wood panelling of--THE XAVIER MANSION.221221Logan walks down the hall, the world hazy around him. He drifts forward, the house teeming with life, students. He passes STORM, alive. She is going over a textbook with a *STUDENT. Logan keeps moving, reeling, trying to focus.*He passes a CLASSROOM, where he sees a grown-up BEAST teaching biology class with MYSTIQUE. Both of them blue.Logan keeps going, catching a glimpse of KITTY and COLOSSUS  walking hand-in-hand. And he sees...BOBBY and ROGUE, just a hazy shot from behind. Perhaps we notice that Rogue no longer has the white streak in her hair.Logan is finally snapped into focus by a voice, a voice he hasn’t heard in many years--VOICE (O.S.)Logan...Logan...? He turns, sees--JEAN Logan, are you okay...? JEAN GREY stands there, alive. LOGANJean...you’re...here. JEANWhere else would I be? He has no answer. He just drifts toward her, raises a hand to her face, as if to make sure she’s real, and--Logan’s wrist is GRABBED by--SCOTTWhoa, easy pal. Logan turns, sees SCOTT “CYCLOPS” SUMMERS, territorial as always. Logan gathers himself.LOGANGuess some things never change. 114.
 
He smiles.LOGAN (CONT’D)It’s good to see you, Scott. Scott is surprised by the sentiment. 221221JEANLogan, is everything alright...? Logan looks at her, looks at the school. LOGANYeah...yeah...(with meaning)I think it is. A moment, a look between them, and--XAVIER (O.S.)Let’s get to class, people. They turn. PROFESSOR XAVIER comes down the hall.XAVIER (CONT’D)Wouldn’t want to be late. Time * waits for no man...or mutant. They head to their respective classes. Logan watches them go, *the X-MEN back together. He smiles, quietly--*LOGAN*You made good on your promise. *Charles looks over at him. *XAVIER*Logan, don’t you have a class to teach?LOGANA class. To teach.XAVIERHistory. *Logan gives a wry smile.LOGANActually, I could use a little help * with that. XAVIERWhat exactly do you need help with?

 
Logan looks at him. LOGANPretty much everything after 1973. Xavier slows, looks at Logan, seeing into his mind. FLASHES of another life, another path. *XAVIER*That’s quite a lot to cover. *LOGAN*I’ve got time. *Xavier gathers himself, nods.*XAVIER221221Well then, let’s begin...*They start to head off together, these two silhouettes moving *away from us.

Bill *leans over him, shines a light in his eyes. *BILL (CONT’D)*Do you know where you are? *LOGAN*No.*BILL*Do you have any idea what happened *to you...?*116.
 
Logan looks up, hazy. *LOGAN*Yeah... I took some really bad *acid.*Bill looks to the soldiers. *BILL*Load him into the truck. *SOLDIER*Yes sir, Captain Stryker. *And we realize for the first time: BILL is CAPTAIN WILLIAM *STRYKER, the greatest enemy mutants will ever know.

As the doors snap shut, we SMASH TO--*EXT. DESERT - NIGHT*Desert, far as the eye can see. We swoop over dunes, mesas, a *few mountains on the edge of the world, and we find--*EXT.

And...He senses something up there. His eyes narrow, focus on a shooting star. He sees it drop out of the sky and--CRASH TO THE EARTH WITH A FLASH OF LIGHT. 117.
 
EXT. CRASH SITE - PAST - NIGHT 227227Erik moves toward the crash site. He looks down into the smoking crater, and sees--An ALIEN FORM rising out of it. Towering, terrifying, with a twisted metal face and dark pits for eyes. This is:APOCALYPSE. APOCALYPSEI have crossed rivers of time to find you. Their faces are close. Erik is stunned. ERIKWho are you? Apocalypse leans forward.APOCALYPSEI am...your future. Apocalypse MERGES with Erik, power coursing through his body. Erik SCREAMS, the energy blasting out of him, shockwaves slamming into the mountains in every direction--LEVELLING THEM with a power greater than any we’ve witnessed. Erik slowly looks out, sees he’s standing in the middle of a BLAST RADIUS that stretches for MILES. His eyes flicker, sensing the possibilities. A smile starts *to curl his lips, as we-- CUT TO BLACK. *
