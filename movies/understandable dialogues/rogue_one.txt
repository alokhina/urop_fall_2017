Rogue One: A Star Wars Story



A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

YOUNG JYN: Mama.
LYRA: We know. Jyn, gather your things, it's time.
SAW: Hello.
LYRA: Saw, it's Lyra.It's happened. He's come for us. SAW: You know what to do.
GALEN:Jyn, come here. Remember, whatever I do, I do it to protect you. Say you understand.
YOUNG JYN: I understand.
GALEN ERSO: I love you, Stardust.
YOUNG JYN: I love you too, Papa.
LYRA: Galen.
GALEN: Go.
LYRA: Jyn.You know where to go, don't you? Trust the Force.
KRENNIC: You're a hard man to find, Galen. But farming? Really, a man of your talents?
GALEN ERSO: It's a peaceful life.
KRENNIC: It's lonely, I imagine.
GALEN ERSO: Since Lyra died, yes.
KRENNIC: Oh. Oh. My condolences. Search the house!
DEATHTROOPER: Understood.
GALEN ERSO: What is it you want?
KRENNIC: The work has stalled, I need you to come back.
GALEN ERSO: I won't do it, Krennic.
KRENNIC: We're on the verge of greatness. We were this close to providing peace, security for the galaxy.
GALEN ERSO: You're confusing peace with terror.
KRENNIC: Do I, huh? You have to start somewhere.
GALEN ERSO: I'll be of no help, Krennic. My mind just isn't what it was. I have trouble remembering, even simple things.
KRENNIC: Galen, you're an inspired scientist but you're a terrible liar. Now I admire the effort, I really do.
KRENNIC: Oh look, here's Lyra back from the dead. It's a miracle.
KRENNIC: Stop!
KRENNIC: Oh, Lyra. Troublesome as ever.
LYRA: You're not taking him.
KRENNIC: No, of course I'm not. I'm taking you all. You'll all come. You, your child, You'll all live in comfort.
LYRA: As hostages.
KRENNIC: As 'heroes of the Empire.'
GALEN: Lyra. Put it down. Think very carefully.
LYRA: You will never win.
KRENNIC: Do it.
GALEN: Lyra! No!
KRENNIC: They have a child. Find it!
SAW GERRERA: My child. Come.Come.We have a long ride ahead of us.

ROGUE ONE

STORMTROOPER: Check in, security. Cell block 4227. 4227.

TIVIK: I was about to leave.
CASSIAN: I came as fast as I could.
TIVIK: I have to get back on board. Walk with me.
CASSIAN: Back to Jedha?
TIVIK: They'll leave without me!
CASSIAN: Easy. You have news from Jedha? Come on.
TIVIK: An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers. He defected yesterday. He's telling people they're making a weapon. The kyber crystals, that's what they're for.
CASSIAN: What kind of weapon?
TIVIK: Look, I have to go.
CASSIAN: What kind of weapon?
TIVIK: A planet killer. That's what he called it.
CASSIAN: A planet killer?
TIVIK: Someone named Erso sent him. Some old friend of Saw's.
CASSIAN: Galen Erso? Was it?
TIVIK: I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left.
CASSIAN: Who else knows this?
TIVIK: I have no idea!It's all falling apart. Saw's right, there're spies everywhere.
STORMTROOPER: What's all this?
STORMTROOPER: Come on, let's see some scandocs.
CASSIAN: Yeah, of course.My gloves?
TIVIK:No, What've you done?
STORMTROOPERS: Troopers down, section 9.
TIVIK: Are you crazy? I'll never climb out of here. My arm...
STORMTROOPER: Get out of the way. Move! Move! CASSIAN:Calm down.Calm down. We'll be all right.

MILITIA: (Sir.)
BODHI:Is that him?He looks kind of different than I imagined. MILITIA: (On your feet! It’s the pilot, the defector) BODHI: Okay, so you're-you're Saw Gerrera? Saw Gerrera. No? Okay, we're just wasting time that we don't have. I need to speak to Saw Gerrera! I keep telling them before, before it's too late. (MILITIA: Keep your heads down! The Imperials will be searching for him…) BODHI: We're out here in the middle of nowhere.We need to get to Jedha City.What part of urgent message do you guys not understand? Hey! we're all on the same side, if you just see past the uniform for a minute. I've got to speak to ah... I've got to speak to Saw Gerrera.

STORMTROOPER: What now?
STORMTROOPER:I don't know. Must be another pick up.
STORMTROOPER:I thought we had everybody.
SOLDIER:All clear, sir.
MELSHI: Hallik! Liana Hallik!
SOLDIER: Her.
MELSHI: You want to get out of here?
PRISONER: Hey! What about me?
K2-SO: [chokeslamming Jyn for trying to escape]Congratulations.You are being rescued. Please do not resist.

PA: LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.
GENERAL DRAVEN:You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik. Is that correct? Possession of unsanctioned weapons, forgery of Imperial documents, aggravated assault,escape from custody, resisting arrest Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out who you really were. Jyn Erso? That's your given name, is it not? Jyn Erso? Daughter of Galen Erso. A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development. JYN ERSO: What is this? MON MOTHMA: It's a chance for you to make a fresh start.
CASSIAN: We think you might be able to help us.
MON MOTHMA: This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence.
CASSIAN: When was the last time you were in contact with your father?
JYN ERSO: 15 years ago.
CASSIAN: Any idea where he's been all that time?
JYN ERSO: I like to think he's dead, makes things easier.
CASSIAN: Easier than what? That he's being a tool of the Imperial war machine?
JYN ERSO: I've never had the luxury of political opinions.
CASSIAN: Really? When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?
JYN ERSO: It's been a long time.
CASSIAN: He'd remember you, though, wouldn't he? He might agree to meet you, if you came as a friend. DRAVEN:We're up against the clock here, girl, So if there's nothing to talk about, we'll just put you back where we found you.
JYN ERSO: I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me. But I've no idea where he is. I haven't seen him in years.
CASSIAN:We know how to find him, that's not our problem. What we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed.
JYN ERSO: You're all rebels, aren't you?
MON MOTHMA: Yes, but Saw Gerrera's an extremist. He's been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust.
JYN ERSO: What does this have to do with my father?
CASSIAN: There's an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot. He's being held by Saw Gerrera. He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he was sent by your father. MON MOTHMA: We need to stop this weapon before it is finished. DRAVEN:Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate the pilot's story and then, if possible, find your father. MON MOTHMA: It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon. Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw,we're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony.
JYN ERSO: And if I do it?
MON MOTHMA: We'll make sure you go free.

GENERAL DRAVEN: Captain Andor!
K2-SO: I'm K-2SO. I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.
JYN ERSO: I remember you.
K2-SO: I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.
JYN ERSO: Apparently so.
K2-SO: That is a bad idea. I think so, and so does Cassian. What do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis.
GENERAL DRAVEN: Galen Erso is vital to the Empire's weapon program. Forget what you heard in there, there will be no extraction. You find him, you kill him.Then and there.
CASSIAN:You met Kay-Tu?
JYN ERSO: Charming.
CASSIAN:He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits. It's a by-product of the reprogram.
K2-SO: Why does she get a blaster, and I don't?
CASSIAN: What.
JYN ERSO: I know how to use it.
CASSIAN: That's what I'm afraid of. Give it to me.
JYN ERSO: We're going to Jedha. That's a war zone.
CASSIAN: That's not the point. Where did you get it?
JYN ERSO: I found it.
K2-SO: I find that answer vague and unconvincing.
JYN: Trust goes both ways.
K2-SO: You're letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It's high.
CASSIAN: Let's get going.
K2-SO: It's very high.

SAW GERRERA: Lies!Deceptions!Let's see it. Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot. Local boy, huh?
BODHI: Uh-huh.
MILITIA: (This was found in his boot when he was captured)
BODHI: Okay, I can hear you.He didn't capture me,I came here myself.I defected, I defected.
SAW GERRERA: Every day, more lies.
BODHI: Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie? No, we don't have time for this! I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it's too late.
BODHI: Okay... So, you... Um. Uh.That's-That's for you. And I gave it to them, they did not find it! I gave it to them. Galen Erso. He told me to find you.
SAW GERRERA: Bor Gullet.
BODHI: Bor Gullet? Galen Erso sent me! He told me to find you!

TARKIN: Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays, and now this. We've heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.
KRENNIC: When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate will be of little concern.
TARKIN: When has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay, you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience.
KRENNIC:I will not fail.

GALEN:What's the matter, Jyn? You looked frightened.I'll always protect you. Stardust. Don't ever change. LYRA:Trust...
LYRA: Galen.

CASSIAN:We're coming into orbit.You have controls.
CASSIAN: That's Jedha.Or what's left of it. We find Saw, we find your father.
JYN:What's with the Destroyer?
CASSIAN:It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera. He's been attacking the cargo shipments.
JYN:What are they bringing in?
CASSIAN: It's 'what are they taking out?' Kyber crystal. All they can get. We wondered why they were stripping the temple, now we know.It's the fuel for the weapon. K2-SO: The weapon your father's building.
JYN ERSO: Maybe we should leave target practice behind.
K2-SO: Are you talking about me?
CASSIAN:She's right.We need to blend in. Stay with the ship.
K2-SO: I can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid. This city is under Imperial occupation
JYN ERSO: Half the people here want to reprogram you. The other half want to put a hole in your head.
K2-SO: I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.
 JYN ERSO: I'm not. I'm just worried they might miss you and hit me.
K2-SO: Doesn't sound so bad to me.

SAW GERRERA: Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts, No lie is safe.What have you really brought me, cargo pilot?Bor Gullet will know the truth.The unfortunate side effect, is that one tends to lose one's mind.
BODHI: No.

DR. EVAZAN: Hey, you just watch yourself.
CASSIAN: No, no.Tourist, we don't want any trouble, sorry. Come on. Come on.
STORMTROOPER: Citizens of Jedha,you must come forward with information of the location of this missing cargo pilot. A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded.
CASSIAN: I had a contact, one of Saw's rebels, but he's just gone missing.His sister will be looking for him. The temple's been destroyed but she'll be there waiting. We'll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw.
JYN: Hope?
CASSIAN: Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope.
STORMTROOPER: Hands where I can see them. Get over there. Show me some identification. Check inside.
JYN: Is this all because of your pilot?
CHIRRUT: May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.
CASSIAN: Wait for me.
CHIRRUT: May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.
CHIRRUT: Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future? Yes, I'm speaking to you. I am Chirrut Îmwe.
JYN ERSO: How did you know I was wearing a necklace?
CHIRRUT: For that answer you must pay. What do you know of kyber crystals?
JYN ERSO: My father, he said they powered the Jedi lightsabers.
CASSIAN: Jyn. Come on, let's go.
CHIRRUT: The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.
CASSIAN: Let's go. We're not here to make friends.
JYN ERSO: Who are they?
CASSIAN: The Guardians of the Whills. Protectors of the Kyber Temple. But there's nothing left to protect, so now they're just causing trouble for everybody.
JYN ERSO: You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.
CASSIAN: We have to hurry. This town, it's ready to blow.
STORMTROOPER: Citizens of the Empire, Imperial forces...
JYN: Tell me you have a backup plan.
STORMTROOPER: Incoming.
STORMTROOPER: Put your guns down.
STORMTROOPER: Behind us.
JYN: Looks like we found Saw's rebels.
CASSIAN: Jyn, no!
MOTHER: Thank you.
STORMTROOPER: Hit the tower.
CITIZEN: Get out of there!
CITIZEN: Quickly, the kyber, get it. Here, take the kyber. Take the kyber.Come on! CASSIAN: This way!
K2-SO: Did you know that wasn't me?
JYN ERSO: Of course!
CASSIAN:I thought I told you to stay on the ship.
K2-SO: You did, but I thought it was boring, and you were in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in.
STORMTROOPER:Freeze right there...
K2-SO: You're right, I should just wait on the ship.
STORMTROOPER:Halt! Stop right there!
STORMTROOPER:Where are you taking these prisoners?
K2-SO: These are prisoners.
STORMTROOPER: Yes. Where are you taking them?
K2-SO: I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison.
CASSIAN: He's taking us to...
K2-SO: Quiet! And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again!
STORMTROOPER: We'll take them from here.
K2-SO: That's okay. If you could just point me in the right direction, I can take them, I'm sure. I've taken them this far…
CASSIAN: Hey, wait a second.
STORMTROOPER: Take them away.
K2-SO: Wait!
STORMTROOPER: Hey, droid.You can't take them away! You stay here. We need to check your diagnostics.
K2-SO: Diagnostics? I'm capable of running my own diagnostics, thank you very much.
CHIRRUT: Let them pass in peace! Let them pass in peace. The Force is with me, and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing, for all is as the Force wills it.
STORMTROOPER: Hey! Stop right there!
STORMTROOPER: He's blind. STORMTROOPER: Is he deaf?
STORMTROOPER: I said: Stop right there!
CHIRRUT: Is your foot all right?
CHIRRUT: You almost shot me.
BAZE: You're welcome.
K2-SO: Clear of hostiles!
K2-SO: One hostile!
JYN: He's with us!
CHIRRUT:They're all right.
JYN:Thanks.
K2-SO: Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.
CASSIAN: Go back to the ship. Wait for my call.
CASSIAN: Is he a Jedi?
BAZE: There are no Jedi here anymore. Only dreamers like this fool.
CHIRRUT: The Force did protect me.
BAZE: I protected you.
JYN: Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?
CHIRRUT: Can't you see we are no friends of the Empire? MILITIA: (Tell that to the one who killed our men.)
JYN ERSO: Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to Saw Gerrera. MILITIA: (And why Is that?) JYN ERSO: Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso. MILITIA: (Take them!)
CHIRRUT: Are you kidding me? I'm blind!

CHIRRUT: I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.
BAZE: You pray?
CHIRRUT: I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.
BAZE: Really?
CHIRRUT: I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.
BAZE: He's praying for the door to open. CHIRRUT: It bothers him, because he knows it is possible. Baze Malbus was once the most devoted Guardian of us all.
CASSIAN: I'm beginning to think the Force and I have different priorities.
BAZE: Relax, Captain. We've been in worse cages than this one.
CASSIAN: This is a first for me.
CHIRRUT: There is more than one sort of prison, Captain, I sense that you carry yours wherever you go.

SAW GERRERA: Jyn. Is it really you? I can't believe it.
JYN ERSO: Must be quite a surprise.
SAW GERRERA: Are we not still friends?
JYN ERSO: The last time I saw you, you gave me a knife and loaded blaster and told me to wait in a bunker until daylight.
SAW GERRERA: I knew you were safe.
JYN ERSO: You left me behind.
SAW GERRERA: You were already the best soldier in my cadre.
JYN ERSO: I was sixteen.
SAW GERRERA: I was protecting you!
JYN ERSO: You dumped me!
SAW GERRERA: You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer! People were starting to figure that out. People who wanted to- to use you as a hostage. Not a day goes by that I don't think of you. But today, of all days? It's a trap, isn't it?
JYN ERSO: What?
SAW GERRERA: The pilot! The message. All of it. Did they... send you? Did you come here to kill me? There's not much of me left.
JYN ERSO: The Alliance wants my father.They think he's sent you a message about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me you might actually help them out.
SAW GERRERA: So what is it that you want, Jyn?
JYN: They wanted an introduction, they've got it. I'm out now. The rest of you can do what you want.
SAW GERRERA: You care not about the cause?
JYN: The cause? Seriously? The Alliance? The...The rebels? Whatever it is you're calling yourself these days?All it's ever brought me is pain.
SAW GERRERA: You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?
JYN: It's not a problem if you don't look up.
SAW GERRERA: I have something to show you, come.

TARKIN: The Emperor is awaiting my report.
KRENNIC: One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion.
TARKIN: And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.
KRENNIC:Your concern is hardly warranted.
TARKIN: If saying it would only make it so.
KRENNIC:All Imperial forces, have been evacuated, and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.
TARKIN: That won't be necessary. We need a statement, not a manifesto. The Holy City will be enough for the day. KRENNIC: Target Jedha City, prepare single reactor ignition.
OFFICER: Sir, we're in position, ready to...
KRENNIC: Fire!
OFFICER: Commence primary ignition.

CHIRRUT: Who's the one in the next cell?
CASSIAN: What? Where?
BAZE: An Imperial pilot.
CASSIAN: Pilot?
BAZE: I'm going to kill him!
CASSIAN: No, no, No, wait!
BAZE: Come here!
CASSIAN: NO!
BAZE: Back off. Back off.
CASSIAN: Okay.
CASSIAN: Are you the pilot? Hey, heyare you the pilot? The shuttle pilot? Pilot?
CHIRRUT: What's wrong with him?
CASSIAN:Galen Erso. You know that name?
BODHI: I brought the message, I'm the pilot.I'm the pilot. I'm the pilot.
CASSIAN: Okay, good. Now where is Galen Erso?

OFFICER: Standby.

SAW GERRERA: This is the message I was sent.
GALEN ERSO: Saw, if you're watching this, then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance.Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and, though I don't dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if she's alive, if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I've missed her. Jyn, my Stardust, I can't imagine what you think of me. When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths. I was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well. As time went by, I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work, if I took my own life, it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable, and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I've placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful, they'll never find it. But, Jyn. Jyn, if you're listening My beloved, so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong, because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It's just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw, the reactor module, that's the key. That's the place I've laid my trap. It's well hidden and unstable, one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station. You'll need the plans, the structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know there's a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station...
CASSIAN: Go. Go.
CASSIAN: K-2? K-2, where are you?
K2-SO: There you are. I'm standing by as you requested. Although there's a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.
CASSIAN: Locate our position. Bring that ship in here now!
CHIRRUT:Where are you going?
CASSIAN: I've got to find Jyn. Get the pilot. We need him.
BAZE: All right. I'll get the pilot.
BAZE: Pilot.
BODHI: No, no, no.
BAZE: Let's go.
CASSIAN: Jyn! We've got to go. I know where your father is.
SAW GERRERA: Go with him, Jyn. You must go.
JYN ERSO: Come with us.
SAW GERRERA: I will run no longer.
CASSIAN: Come on.
JYN ERSO: But you must save yourself.
CASSIAN: Come on.
SAW GERRERA: Go! There's no time! Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!

KRENNIC: Oh. It's beautiful.

BAZE: Chirrut, let's go! CASSIAN: [to Bodhi]Come on! Let's get out of here!
CASSIAN: Get us out of here! Punch it!
K2-SO: I'm not very optimistic about our odds.
CASSIAN: Let's not, K. Come on! Punch it.
K2-SO:I haven't completed my calculation.
CASSIAN: I'll make them for you.

TARKIN:I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations.
KRENNIC: And you'll tell the Emperor as much?
TARKIN: I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.
KRENNIC: That was only an inkling of it's destructive potential. TARKIN:I will tell him, that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago effective immediately.
KRENNIC: We stand here amid my achievement not yours!
TARKIN:I'm afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.
KRENNIC: The breaches have been filled, Jedha has been silenced.
TARKIN:You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso's facility.
KRENNIC: We'll see about this.

REBEL: A coded message from Captain Andor, sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise.
GENERAL DRAVEN: Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.

CHIRRUT: Baze, tell me. All of it? The whole city?Tell me.
BODHI: All of it.
CASSIAN: Understood. Set a course for Eadu.
K2-SO: Setting course for Eadu.
JYN: Is that where my father is?
CASSIAN: I think so.
BODHI: So you're Galen's daughter.
JYN: You know him?
BODHI: I'm Bodhi, the pilot.
JYN: You brought the message.
BODHI: Yes, your father... He said I could get right by myself.He said I could make it right, if I was brave enough and listened to what was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late.
JYN: It wasn't too late.
BODHI: Seems pretty late to me.
JYN: No. We can beat the people who did this. My father's message, I've seen it.They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there's a way to defeat it. You're wrong about my father.
CASSIAN: He did build it.
JYN: Because he knew they'd do it without him. My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He's rigged a trap inside it.That's why he sent you. To bring that message.
CASSIAN: Where is it? Where's the message?
JYN: It was a hologram.
CASSIAN: You have that message, right?
JYN: Everything happened so fast.
CASSIAN: Did you see it?
JYN: You don't believe me.
CASSIAN: I'm not the one you've got to convince.
CHIRRUT: I believe her.
CASSIAN: That's good to know.
BAZE:What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap.
JYN: The reactor. He's placed a weakness there. He's been hiding it for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance.
CASSIAN: I've done that.
JYN: They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing. They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.
CASSIAN: I can't risk sending that. We're in the heart of Imperial territory.
JYN:Then we'll find him. And bring him back, and he can tell them himself.

IMPERIAL NAVIGATOR: Course set for Eadu, sir.

CHIRRUT: I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.
K2-SO: 20 degrees to the right. 10 degrees up.
BODHI: No, no, no, lower. Lower!
K2-SO: Are you sure this is the way?
BODHI: They have landing trackers. They have patrol squadrons. You've got to stay in the canyon, keep it low.
CASSIAN: Watch your right!
K2-SO: There's a 26% chance of failure.
CASSIAN: How much farther?
BODHI: I don't know. I'm not sure, I never really come this way, but we're close, we're close. I know that.
K2-SO: Well, now there's a 35% chance of failure.
BODHI: I don't want to know, thank you.
K2-SO: I understand.
BODHI: Now! Put it down now!
K2-SO: The wind...
BODHI: If you keep going, you'll be right over the shuttle depot. Watch out!
K2-SO: Hey!
CASSIAN: Hold on tight! We're coming down hard!

DRAVEN: Try them again.
REBEL: I am, sir. We... The signal's gone dead.
DRAVEN: Squadron up, target Eadu.

BODHI: How about now, check stabilizers?
CASSIAN: Bodhi, where's the lab?
BODHI: The research facility?
CASSIAN: Yeah. Where is it?
BODHI: It's just over the ridge.
CASSIAN: And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us? You are sure of that?
BODHI: Yes.We'll have to hope there's still an Imperial ship left to steal. 
CASSIAN: Here's what we're doing. Hopefully, the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here.Bodhi, you're coming with me. We'll go up the ridge and check it out.
JYN: I'm coming with you.
CASSIAN: No, your father's message, we can't risk it. You're the messenger.
JYN: That's ridiculous. We all got the message.Everyone here knows it. K2-SO:One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down. That's how you said it. The whole system goes down.
CASSIAN: Get to work fixing our comms!All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we're up against.So, we're going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what's what. Let's get out of here.
CHIRRUT: Does he look like a killer?
BAZER: No. He has the face of a friend.
JYN: Who are you talking about?
CHIRRUT: Captain Andor.
JYN: Why do you ask that? What do you mean, does he look like a killer?
CHIRRUT: The Force moves darkly near a creature that's about to kill.
K2-SO: His weapon was in the sniper configuration.

BODHI: No, no, no... We got to go up. You can't see much from down there. 
BODHI:This way. CASSIAN:I'll be right behind you. Come on.

BAZE: Where are you going?
CHIRRUT: I'm going to follow Jyn. Her path is clear.
BAZE: Alone? Good luck!
CHIRRUT: I don't need luck, I have you!
K2-SO: What are they doing? If Cassian comes back, we're leaving without them.

CASSIAN: You see Erso out there?
BAZE:We've come too far.
CHIRRUT:Patience, my friend.
BODHI: That's him. That's him, Galen, in the dark suit.
CASSIAN:Get back down there, and find us a ride out of here.
BODHI: What are you doing?
CASSIAN: You heard me.
BODHI: You said we came up here just to have a look.
CASSIAN:I'm here, I'm looking. Go.Hurry!

KRENNIC: Excellent news, Galen. The battle station is complete. You must be very proud.
GALEN ERSO: Proud as I can be, Krennic.
KRENNIC: Gather your engineers, I have an announcement. Is that all of them?
GALEN ERSO: Yes.
KRENNIC: Gentlemen.One of you betrayed the Empire. One of you has conspired with a pilot to send messages to the Rebellion. And I urge that traitor step forward.
KRENNIC: Very well, I'll consider it a group effort, then. Ready!
ENGINEER: No.
ENGINEER: No, please.
KRENNIC: Aim... and...
ENGINEER: No, no.
KRENNIC: fire!
GALEN ERSO:Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me. It was me. They have nothing to do with it. Spare them.
KRENNIC: Fire!
KRENNIC: How do I know the weapon is complete?
GALEN ERSO: Let me share with you some details.

K2-SO: Cassian. Cassian, can you hear me?
CASSIAN: I'm here.You got it working.
K2-SO:Affirmative yes, although we have a problem! There's an Alliance squadron approaching.
REBEL PILOT: Clear the area!
CASSIAN: No. No, no, no!Tell them to hold up!Jyn's on that platform!

KRENNIC: Jedha. Saw Gerrera.His band of fanatics. Their Holy City. The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone. GALEN: You'll never win.
KRENNIC:Now where have I heard that before?

K2-SO:Relay from Captain Andor.
REBEL: General.
K2-SO: Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support. Alliance forces onsite.Please confirm.
DRAVEN: Get the squadron leader on, Get him on now!
REBEL:They're already engaged, sir.

CASSIAN: Dead. No.
KRENNIC:Return fire! To your stations. Get our fighters in the air now!
JYN:Father!

SOLDIER: Go, go, go, go.
SOLDIER: Fall back! Fall back!
SOLDIER: Director, we need to evacuate.
JYN: Papa. Papa, it's me. It's Jyn.
GALEN ERSO: Jyn.Stardust.
JYN: Papa.I've seen your message. The hologram, I've seen it.
GALEN ERSO: It must be destroyed.
JYN: I know. I know. We will.
GALEN ERSO: Jyn.Look at you.I've so much to tell you.
JYN: Papa.No. No. Papa!Papa! Come on.
STORMTROOPER: Over there, take them down.
CASSIAN: Come on. Jyn, we've got to go. Come on.
JYN: I can't leave him,
CASSIAN: Listen to me. He's gone. There's nothing you can do. Come on.
JYN: I can't leave him.
CASSIAN: Come on! Help me. Move!
CASSIAN: Down!
CASSIAN:Come on. Come on.
K2-SO: Well done.You're a Rebel now.
CASSIAN: Let's go, let's go. Come on, let's move! Come on, let's get out of here. Move, move, move. Okay, K-2, let's go.
K-2SO: Copy that.

CASSIAN: Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.
K2-SO: Understood.
JYN: You lied to me.
CASSIAN: You're in shock.
JYN: You went up there to kill my father.
CASSIAN: You don't know what you're talking about.
JYN: Deny it.
CASSIAN: You're in shock, and looking for someplace to put it.
JYN: I've seen it before.
CASSIAN: I bet you have.
JYN: They know.You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone.
CASSIAN: I had every chance to pull the trigger. But did I? Did I?
JYN: You might as well have. My father was living proof and you put him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed him!
CASSIAN: I had orders! Orders that I disobeyed! But you wouldn't understand that.
JYN: Orders?When you know they're wrong? You might as well be a stormtrooper.
CASSIAN: What do you know? We don't all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I've been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You're not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it.
JYN: You can't talk your way around this.
CASSIAN: I don't have to. Yavin Four! Make sure they know we're coming in with a stolen ship.
Anybody else?

VANEE: My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.
DARTH VADER: Director Krennic.
KRENNIC: Lord Vader.
DARTH VADER:You seem unsettled.
KRENNIC:No. Just pressed for time. There're a great many things to attend to.
DARTH VADER:My apologies. You do have a great many things to explain.
KRENNIC:I've delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable… potential.
DARTH VADER:Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked.
KRENNIC:It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test.
DARTH VADER:You were not summoned here to grovel, Director Krennic.
KRENNIC: No, it’s...
DARTH VADER: There is no Death Star. The Senate has been informed that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.
KRENNIC:Yes, my lord.
DARTH VADER:I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way.
KRENNIC:So I'm still in command? You'll speak to the Emperor about…
DARTH VADER:Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director.

PAMLO: We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender.
ORGANA: Are we really talking about disbanding something that we've worked so hard to create?
RADDUS: We can't just give in.
VASPAR: We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!
ORGANA: We've only now managed to gather our forces.
JEBEL: Gather our forces? General Draven's already blown up an Imperial base!
DRAVEN: A decision needed to be made.
PAMLO: If it's war you want, you'll fight alone!
VASPAR: If that's the way it's going, why have an Alliance at all?
RADDUS: If she's telling the truth, we need to act now!
MON MOTHMA: Councilors, please!
BLUE LEADER: It is simple, the Empire has the means of mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.
JEBEL: A Death Star, this is nonsense.
JYN ERSO: What reason would my father have to lie? What benefit would it bring him?
DRAVEN:To lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all. VASPAR:To risk everything, based on what? The testimony of a criminal? The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist?
JEBEL: Don't forget the Imperial pilot.
JYN ERSO: My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this.
DODONNA: So you've told us.
PAMLO: If the Empire has this kind of power, what chance do we have?
JYN: What chance do we have? The question is 'What choice?' Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now!
REBEL: Yes. JYN:Every moment you waste is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha.
REBEL: What is she proposing?
REBEL: Just let the girl speak!
JYN ERSO: Send your best troops to Scarif.Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it.
PAMLO: You're asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope?
JYN ERSO: Rebellions are built on hope.
VASPAR: There is no hope.
RADDUS: I say we fight.
JEBEL: I say the Rebellion is finished.
MON MOTHMA: I'm sorry, Jyn. Without the full support of the council, the odds are too great.

PA: General Syndulla, please report to the briefing room.
BAZE:You don't look happy.
JYN: They prefer to surrender.
BAZE: And you?
CHIRRUT: She wants to fight.
BODHI: So do I. We all do.
CHIRRUT: The Force is strong.
JYN: I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.
BAZE: How many do we need?
JYN: What are you talking about?
CASSIAN:They were never going to believe you.
JYN: I appreciate the support.
CASSIAN: But I do. I believe you.We'd like to volunteer. Some of us... ... most of us, we've done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion. We're spies. Saboteurs. Assassins. Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion. And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that, we're lost.Everything we've done would have been for nothing. I couldn't face myself if I gave up now. None of us could. It won't be comfortable. BODHI:It'll be a bit cramped, but we'll all fit.We could go.
CASSIAN: Okay. Gear up. Grab anything that's not nailed down. Go, go, go!
K2-SO: Jyn. I'll be there for you. Cassian said I had to.
JYN: I'm not used to people sticking around when things go bad.
CASSIAN: Welcome home.

PA: Bravo team to the Intelligence office for extraction mission report.
JYN: May the Force be with us.
FLIGHT CONTROLLER: Cargo shuttle, read back, please. What's going on out there? That ship's off limits. No one is suppose to be on board until farther instructions.
BODHI: Yes, yes we are. Affirmative.
 FLIGHT CONTROLLER: That's an impounded Imperial ship. What's your call sign, pilot?
BODHI: Um.
JYN ERSO: We have to go.
BODHI:It-It's um...
JYN: Say something. Come on.
BODHI: Rogue... Rogue One.
FLIGHT CONTROLLER: Rogue One? There is no Rogue One.
K2-SO: Well, there is now.
BODHI: Rogue One, pulling away.
K2-SO: Pulling away.

MON MOTHMA: Despite what the others say, war is inevitable.
SENATOR ORGANA: Yes, I agree. I must return to Alderaan to inform my people that there will be no peace. We will need every advantage.
MON MOTHMA: Your friend, the Jedi.
SENATOR ORGANA: He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's purge. Yes, I will send for him.
MON MOTHMA: You'll need someone you can trust.
SENATOR ORGANA: I would trust her with my life. Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you.
CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Senator.

BODHI: Okay, we're coming in. There's a planetwide defensive shield with a single main entry gate. This shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through.
K2-SO: Assuming, the Empire hasn't logged it as overdue.
BODHI: Or stolen. JYN:And if they have?
BODHI:Then,they shut the gate and we're all annihilated in the cold, dark vacuum of space.
K2-SO: Not me, I can survive in space.
BODHI: Okay. Here it goes. Cargo shuttle SW-0608 requesting a landing pad.
GATE GUARD: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, you're not listed on the arrival schedule.
BODHI: Acknowledged, Gate Control. We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station. Transmitting clearance code now.
K2-SO: Transmitting.
GATE GUARD: Cargo shuttle SW-0608? You are cleared for entry.
BODHI:- Yes!
K2-SO: Impressive. JYN: I'll tell the others.
BODHI: Okay.

FLIGHT CONTROLLER: SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9. Acknowledge, please.
BODHI: SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed.
CASSIAN: The main building down there, what is it?
BODHI:That's the Citadel Tower. They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there. If the plans are anywhere, they'll be there.
CASSIAN: The dish at the top? What's it for?
BODHI: I guess it takes a lot of signals to send those data files out.
K2-SO: Landing track engaged
BODHI: Landing track locked.
CASSIAN: We're landing. We're coming in!
JYN: Saw Gerrera used to say,1 fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day. They have no idea we're coming. They have no reason to expect us. If we can make it to the ground, we'll take the next chance. And the next.On and on until we win... or the chances are spent. The Death Star plans are down there.Cassian,K2, and I will find them. We'll find a way to find them. 
CASSIAN: Melshi, Pao, Baze, Chirrut, you'll take main squad, move east and get wide of the ship. Find a position between here and the tower.Once you get to the best spot, light the place up. Make ten men feel like a hundred.
BAZE: All right.
CASSIAN: And get those troopers away from us.
BODHI: What should I do?
CASSIAN: Keep the engine running. You're our only way out of here.

STORMTROOPER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, be prepared to receive inspection team.
JYN: Ready?
INSPECTOR: Hello.
BODHI: Hey, you're probably looking for a manifest.
INSPECTOR: That would be helpful. BODHI: It's just down here.

PILOT: Director Krennic, we are entering the Scarif shield gate. General Ramda has been informed of your arrival.

BAZE: Good luck, little sister.
BODHI: Go! Go now, you're clear!
MELSHI: All right, let's go. Come on. Move, move, move.
K2-SO: I have a bad feeling about…
CASSIAN: Kay!
JYN ERSO: Quiet.
K2-SO: What?

CASSIAN: We need a map.
K2-SO: Well, I'm sure there's one just lying about.
CASSIAN: You know what you have to do.

MELSHI: One per pad. Pick your spot. We want to draw them out. I'll call the timing. Go!
STORMTROOPER: Hey, did you hear the rumors?
STORMTROOPER:Yeah, the T-15s have been marked obsolete.
STORMTROOPER:Oh boy, it's about time for that.
STORMTROOPER: Hey.
STORMTROOPER: Watch out.
STORMTROOPER: What the...?

RAMDA: Director, what brings you to Scarif?
KRENNIC: Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission he has ever sent called up for inspection.
RAMDA: All of them?
KRENNIC: Yes. All of them. Get started.

CASSIAN: Kay?
K2-SO: Our optimal route to the data vault places only 89 stormtroopers in our path. We will make it no more than 33% of the way before we are killed.
CASSIAN: Melshi, talk to me.
MELSHI: Ready, ready. Standing by.
CASSIAN: Light it up.

KRENNIC: Are we blind?Deploy the garrison! Move!

TONC: Troopers! Troopers. Troopers on the left!

ROMODI: Sir? Scarif base, they're reporting a rebel incursion.
TARKIN: I want to speak to Director Krennic.
ROMODI: He's there, sir. On Scarif.
TARKIN: The original plans for this station are kept there, are they not?
ROMODI: They are.
TARKIN: Prepare for the jump to hyperspace and inform Lord Vader.

VAULT GUARD: Can I help you?
K2-SO: That won't be necessary.

REBEL: Senator! Senator.
BLUE LEADER: Stop right there, Private. MON MOTHMA: Let him speak.
REBEL: Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma'am. Rebels on Scarif. MON MOTHMA: I need to speak to Admiral Raddus.
REBEL: He's returned to his ship.He's gone to fight.

REBEL: No!

PA: Attention all flight personnel,please report to your commanders immediately. Attention all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately. We have been redirected to Scarif. Pilots, you'll be briefed by your squadron leaders on route.May the Force be with you.
C-3PO: Scarif?They're going to Scarif? Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo? [R2 beeps] Yeah, nobody tells us anything.

MELSHI: Fall back! Fall back!
CHIRRUT: Keep drawing them out!
MELSHI: Go. Go. Move. Move.Come on, move up!

IMPERIAL: Pad 12 report to ground. Coming at our flank, we're outnumbered.
IMPERIAL: Pad 12 team, what's going on down there. Status, please. All Pads report in immediately.
IMPERIAL:Unknown, we have rebels everywhere.
IMPERIAL: We're taking fire, Pad 12, Pad 14 request assistance.
BODHI: This is Pad 2, Pad 2. I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2. Get on there, tell him pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.
TONC: This is Pad 5, we're being overrun. Help us!
IMPERIAL: Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm.Confirm and report. Get reinforcements down to Pad 5 immediately!

CASSIAN: This is not working, Kay.
K2-SO: Right hand.

CHIRRUT: Baze! Baze!
BAZE: What?
CHIRRUT: Run! REBEL:Retreat. Retreat!

RADDUS: This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance. All Squadron leaders report in.
BLUE LEADER: Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.
GOLD LEADER: This is Gold Leader, standing by.
RED LEADER: This is Red Leader, standing by.

Sir, those are rebel ships.
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately.

Director, the rebel fleet, it's amassing outside the shield.
KRENNIC: Lock down the base. Lock down.
- And close the shield?
KRENNIC: Do it!

RADDUS: Red and Gold squadron, attack formations. Defend the fleet. Blue squadron, get to the surface before they closed that gate.
BLUE LEADER: Copy, your Admiral. Blue squadron, on me.
BLUE FOUR: Copy, Blue Leader.
BLUE FIVE: Copy, Blue Leader.
BLUE EIGHT: We won't have long. SHIELD OFFICER: Close the field aperture now. Close it!
BLUE SIX: Come on, come on, come on!
BLUE FOUR: Pull up!

K2-SO: Rebel fleet has arrived.
JYN: What?
K2-SO: There's fighting on the beach, they've locked down the base, they've closed the shield gate.
JYN: What does that mean? We're trapped?
K2-SO: We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet. We'd have to get a signal out to tell them it's coming.It's the size of the data files. That's the problem.They'll never get through.Someone has to take that shield gate down.
CASSIAN: Bodhi.Bodhi, can you hear me?Bodhi, tell me you're out there. Bodhi!
BODHI: Hello, I'm here. We're standing by. They've started fighting, the base is on lockdown!
CASSIAN: I know, listen to me!The rebel fleet is up there.You've got to tell them to blow a hole in the shield gate so we can transmit the plans.
BODHI: Wait, I can't. I'm not hooked into the comm tower. We're not tied in.
CASSIAN: It's the only way we're getting them out of here. Find a way! Cover our backs.
JYN ERSO: You'll need this. You wanted one, right?
K2-SO: Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected.
CASSIAN: Jyn. Come on.

AT-AT PILOT: Fire on my command.
BAZE: Look!

BODHI: Get ready. We're going to have to go out there.
REBEL:What're you doing?
BODHI:They closed the shield gate, we're stuck here. But, the rebel fleet is pulling in.We just have to get a signal strong enough to get through to them and let them know we're trapped down here. For that, we have to connect to the communications tower. Now, I can patch us in over here, the landing pad but you have to get on the radio, get one of the guys out there to find a master switch. Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower. REBEL: Okay.
BODHI: Then go!

RADDUS:What's going on down there, Lieutenant?
LIEUTENANT: Unknown, sir. We can't raise them. All rebel frequencies are blocked.
RADDUS: Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers and let's start probing that shield.
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir. 
RED LEADER: We're going in.
RED LEADER:Stay with me.
K2-SO: Schematics bank, Data tower two.
CASSIAN: How do I find that?
K2-SO: Searching. I can locate the tape, but you'll need the handles for extraction.
CASSIAN: What are we supposed to do with these? Whoa.
K2-SO: Well, finally.
STORMTROOPER: Wait, stop.
K2-SO:The rebels! They went over there.
CASSIAN: Kay. What's going on out there?
K2-SO: There's one. Oh well.
RED PILOT:Come on!
GOLD LEADER: Red Leader, this is Gold Leader,we're starting our attack run on the shield gate. Keep it tight and watch out for those towers.
GOLD PILOT: More fighters. Form up, at 65.
LIEUTENANT: Sir, enemy fighters coming in.

TONC: Melshi. Melshi, come in, are you there? Bodhi will send a signal from here. He's patching us in.But you guys have to open up a line for the tower. MELSHI: How? Please advise.
TONC: There's a master switch to the base of the Comm tower.
MELSHI: Master switch, describe, what are we looking for? TONC: What does it look like? The master switch? Where is it?

BLUE LEADER: Two wings, reinforce those troops on the beach. All fighters, on me. We have to shield them from air attack.
BLUE ELEVEN: Troop reinforcements.
REBEL MARINE: Here we go. For Jedha!
MARINE: Jedha!

RED PILOT: We have no effect on that shield. GOLD PILOT: How much more can that thing take?
RED PILOT: Stick close, Red 5, where are you going?
RED 5: I'm trying to lose them. This is Red 5, I need help!

JYN: Hyperspace Tracking, Navigational Systems.
K2-SO: Two screens down. Structural Engineering, open that one!

BLUE LEADER: I got one on my tail.
BLUE:I'm on it.

JYN: Project code names: Stellarsphere. Mark Omega. Pax Aurora. War-Mantle. Cluster-Prism.
Black-Saber.
CASSIAN: What?
JYN ERSO: Stardust. That's it.
CASSIAN: How do you know that?
JYN ERSO: I know because it's me.

STORMTROOPER: Hey, you. Identify yourself.
BODHI: I can explain.
STORMTROOPER: Incoming fire, take cover!

CASSIAN: Kay, we need the file for Stardust!
K2-SO: Stardust.
JYN: That's it.
CASSIAN: Kay.
K2-SO: Climb.Climb. You can still send the plans to the fleet. If they open the shield gate, you can broadcast from the tower! Locking the vault door now.
CASSIAN: Kay.Kay!
K2-SO: Good bye.
CASSIAN: Kay!

SOLDIER: Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault.
KRENNIC: What.
SOLDIER: It's just come in, sir.
KRENNIC: Send my guard squadron into battle! Two men with me now! Get that beach under control!

CASSIAN: Bodhi?Are you there? Have you got the switch?
BODHI: I can't get to the shuttle, I can't plug in!
CASSIAN: You have to! They have to hit that gate. If the shield's open, we can send the plans!

BLUE : General, behind you!
REBEL: Take them out.

JYN:Step back.

BLUE ELEVEN: We're going down!
REBEL: Come on! Look out.

BODHI: Melshi.Melshi, come in please.
MELSHI: I'm tied in at my end, I just need an open line. Hang on. The master switch, it's over at that console. I'm going!
 JYN: I've got it.
CASSIAN: Careful!You okay?
CASSIAN:Jyn!

CHIRRUT: I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.
BAZE: Chirrut!
CHIRRUT: I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.
BAZE: Chirrut, come back!
BODHI: Yes!

CASSIAN: Keep going.Keep going!
JYN: Cassian.

BAZE: Chirrut, come! Come with me! 
BAZE: Chirrut!Chirrut, don't go. Don't go.
BAZE: I'm here.I'm here.It's okay.It's okay.
CHIRRUT: Look for the Force…
BAZE: Chirrut.
CHIRRUT: …and you will always find me. The Force is with me. I'm one with the Force. The Force is with me. I'm one with the Force. The Force is with me. 
BAZE: and I'm one with the Force.

LIEUTENTANT Deflector shield's down to 50%, we're sustaining heavy damage.
RADDUS: There's no turning back now, we have to press the attack. 
GOLD LEADER: Hit that opening.
GOLD NINE: We see it, Gold Leader. Ion torpedoes away.
OFFICER:- What's happening?
IMPERIAL: We've lost engine power, sir.
RADDUS: That Star Destroyer is disabled.
BODHI: This is Rogue One, calling any Alliance ships that can hear me! Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One! Come in, over.
RADDUS: This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One, we hear you!
BODHI: We have the plans! They found the Death Star plans. They have to transmit them from the communications tower! You have to take down the shield gate. It's the only way to going to get them through!
RADDUS: Call up a Hammerhead corvette. I have an idea. Standby, Rogue One, we're on it.
BODHI: This is for you, Galen.

BAZE: The Force is with me. I'm one with the Force.

HAMMERHEAD CAPTAIN: Corvette 5, locked on target. Prepare for impact.
HAMMERHEAD CAPTAIN:Sublight thrusters, full power!

COMPUTER: Reset antenna alignment.Reset antenna alignment.Reset antenna alignment. Reset antenna alignment.
IMPERIAL OFFICER: Reverse engines, full power!

COMPUTER: Antenna alignment. Ready to transmit.
KRENNIC: Who are you?
JYN ERSO: You know who I am. I'm Jyn Erso. Daughter of Galen and Lyra. You've lost.
KRENNIC: Oh, I have, have I?
JYN ERSO: My father's revenge. He built a flaw in the Death Star. He put a fuse in the middle of your machine and I've just told the entire galaxy how to light it. 
KRENNIC: The shield is up, your signal will never reach the rebel base. All you ships in here will be destroyed. I lose nothing but time. YOU on the other hand die with the Rebellion.

COMPUTER: Transmitting. Transmitting.

LIEUTENANT: Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif.

CASSIAN:Hey, leave it. Leave it. That's it.That's it. Let's go.

COMPUTER: Transmission received.
LIEUTENANT: Admiral, we have the plans!
RADDIS: She did it.

CASSIAN: Do you think, anybody is listening?
JYN: I do. Someone's out there.

LIEUTENANT: Sir, we're detecting a massive object emerging from hyperspace.

ROMODI: Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?
TARKIN: Lord Vader will handle the fleet. Target the base at Scarif. Single reactor ignition. ROMODI: Yes, sir.
TARKIN: You may fire when ready. 
ROMODI: Commence primary ignition.
