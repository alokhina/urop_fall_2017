INT. GLIDE-TRAIN - EUROMERICA - DAY
SOARING CITY rolling past outside the windows, we’re TIGHT
ON DOUGLAS QUAID - handsome, working man, soulful eyes
presently engrossed in an old paperback SPY NOVEL, his
expression reflecting pure absorption in what he’s reading
as he ignores the bustling world around him.
SOUND BLEEDS IN to his/our ears as we hear a voice:
HARRY (O.S.)
...have you heard a word I’ve said?
Quaid looks up, and now reveal his burly friend HARRY
sitting next to him. Like Quaid and the other passengers
around them, Harry strikes us as blue collar (in contrast
to UPSCALE PASSENGERS on the far side of the car).
QUAID
What?
HARRY
Forget it. I’m done wasting all my good
conversations on you.
Quaid chuckles. Returns to his spy novel.
HARRY
You know, you’re the only guy I know who
reads books. Where do you even buy those?
QUAID
Believe it or not, there are people who
consider these classics. You should try
one some time.
(off Harry’s look)
Seriously, you get lost in one of these,
you forget where you are, who you are.
HARRY
Why would I want to forget who I am?
QUAID
(sarcastic)
What, wouldn’t want to miss a second of
that exciting lifestyle of yours?
Punching in at a factory every day?
Staring at the same parts hour after
hour?
Harry cracks a smile, as outside the passing city begins
to slow. Around them, passengers gather belongings as the
train pulls into a STATION.
1.
HARRY
It’s just a job, it’s not my whole life.
I got other things that make me happy.
The doors suck open. Quaid and Harry step out onto
THE STATION PLATFORM
QUAID
Such as?
HARRY
Friends like you, for instance. Always
with the positive attitude.
Gets a laugh from Quaid.
HARRY
I’m serious, I’m gonna start calling you
Mr. Sunshine -
BOOOOOM!! An ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS from a 2ND TRAIN
unloading across the station platform...
GLASS in their own car blowing out, knocking Quaid and
Harry back. Quaid sees a hunk of DEBRIS hurtling right at
them -
QUAID
Harry!
He shoves Harry out of the way, taking the brunt of the
hit himself as it sends him sprawling across the platform.
O.S. we suddenly hear a SHRIEK OF METAL as
THE MAGNETIC INDUCTION TRACK supporting the 2nd train
gives way - and suddenly
THE TRAIN FALLS. The first mangled car dragging the
others behind it after...
Faces of TERRIFIED PASSENGERS in the windows flashing past
as the train sucks down through the mangled hole in the
platform...
MONSTROUS PIECES of the destroyed magneto track go
cartwheeling down into the abyss of the city... followed
by the TRAIN itself -
Passing the geological stratas of architectural styles of
a city built upon a city...
2.
Until - the TRAIN PILE-DRIVES at street-level far below in
a successive firecracker detonation of cars.
TIGHT ON QUAID SPLAYED OUT ON THE PLATFORM
Semi-conscious as he dazedly squints up into the smoke and
debris...
QUAID’S POV: The platform a blur, the world itself is
MUTED - a faint RINGING in our ears the only sound until
WOMAN (O.S.)
(faintly)
Are you hurt?
Quaid struggles to focus... as into his field of vision a
WOMAN appears through the smoke - dark hair, utterly
beautiful. It’s almost dream-like as she hovers over him,
like an angel.
WOMAN
Hello? Are you hurt?
Quaid blinks up at her, bewildered, awed.
QUAID
(breathless)
...Who are you?
The Woman allows a curious smile at this odd question.
WOMAN
My name’s Melina.
Something about the name too has Quaid captivated.
QUAID
Melina...
She smiles again at him, reaches to help him up -
MELINA
Here, let me help you...
- when from off-screen there’s a POP-FLASH OF LIGHT -
Quaid turns his head to find a damaged section of overhead
lighting has crashed to the platform.
Quaid turns back to Melina - but she’s gone...
...In her place is Harry, bending to help Quaid to his
feet. SOUND RUSHING BACK IN now as Quaid becomes aware of
all the surrounding CHAOS - the POLICE VEHICLES and
OFFICERS flooding the ravaged platform.
3.
POLICE MEGAPHONE (O.S.)
Please remain calm. Exit your trains and
report to the platform triage stations
for medical examination and clearance.
HARRY
You all right? I owe you one.
QUAID
(bewildered)
Yeah, I’m okay...
Quaid’s eyes roam the chaos, still in a state of semishock
- when he spots what could be Melina among the dense
crowd being ushered off the platform - but he only
glimpses the back of her before she’s gone.
FEDERAL POLICE, slickly uniformed, ID’s prominently
displayed immediately begin to round up anyone of bluecollar
appearance who looks remotely suspicious.
FEDERAL POLICE AGENT
(brusk, to a WORKER)
Identification and resident status...
Harry looks uneasy, tugs at Quaid’s sleeve.
HARRY
Come on. We should get outta here.
They join the throngs scattering in the aftermath.
NEWSCASTER PRE-LAP
The death-toll on the Magnetic Induction
Line at the Quad 4 32nd Level is at 144
and still rising this morning...
TIGHT ON A NEWS BROADCAST
A NEWSCASTER speaking dryly and earnestly over images of
the still-burning WRECKAGE of the train...
NEWSCASTER
This marks the fourth attack in as many
months, and once again all signs point to
terrorist leader Quatto and his
resistance movement, who are clearly
stepping up the frequency and brutality
of their assaults.
WIDEN TO REVEAL we are in
4.
INT. SYNTH PROCESSING FACTORY - LOCKER ROOM - DAY
NEWS playing for WORKERS at lockers, preparing for work.
There’s one unused locker with a taped tag: “MARCUS.”
Beside it we find Quaid and Harry, lockers side by side.
As Quaid changes into work-clothes, a co-worker (MURPHY)
notices a bruise from where the debris hit Quaid.
MURPHY
Damn. You okay?
Quaid nods, half-paying attention the newscast:
NEWSCASTER
The last such incident occurred six weeks
ago, when the bombing of a Federal
laboratory killed 23 workers. The fact
that those victims were working on a
project to improve environmental
conditions in the colony of New Asia was
not lost on Chancellor Cohaagen, who
pointed to this as proof that Quatto does
not seek a better life for those in New
Asia, as his followers claim, but rather
a prolonged conflict. You may recall
that Federal Police have since attributed
that bombing to this man -
PHOTO ON NEWS of CARL HAUSER: hard features, intense.
NEWSCASTER
- Carl Hauser, a former Intelligence
Officer turned traitor, now considered to
be Quatto’s right hand man. No word yet
as to whether Hauser had a role in this
morning’s incident as well. Again, if
you’re just joining us, there has been
yet another attack byAN
ABRUPT TONE BLARES, signalling the workers to move out.
Lockers are shut, men starting for the doors.
ON QUAID as he clocks their gruff faces: everyone dressed
more or less the same, equally resigned to the day ahead.
Quaid reluctantly enters the flow of workers, just another
cog in the machine.
INT. SYNTH PROCESSING LINE - DAY
Quaid at his station on a giant ASSEMBLY LINE that
stretches away almost out of sight. We spot Harry in a
bay next to Quaid’s.
5.
Like all the other factory workers in here, Quaid labors
over a procession of SYNTHS - highly-advanced, rubberskinned
robots, splayed partially open to reveal their
substructure and components.
There’s a conspicuous vacancy on the line a slot away from
Quaid’s. A FOREMAN approaches, escorting a NEW WORKER to
the vacant spot.
FOREMAN
(flatly)
You’ll be posted here now. Slot 872-G.
Activation division. Spent much time
around synths?
NEW WORKER
Not really, no.
FOREMAN
Well the bad news is they’re even more
complicated than they look. Good news is
they’re police bots, so they’re pretty
goddamn hard to break. Any questions,
Quaid there can answer them.
The Foreman leaves as bruskly as he arrived. The New
Worker nods tentatively at Quaid by way of greeting.
QUAID
What happened to Marcus?
NEW WORKER
Who?
QUAID
Marcus. The guy you’re replacing?
NEW WORKER
(shrugs; couldn’t care less)
Got me.
Quaid registers this: the expendable nature of a worker.
The New Worker hunkers down to his new job, seemingly
oblivious to the mundanity of the task.
QUAID
(helpful)
You might want to move your hand when you
weld the ocular assembly. If your synth
shorts out, that plasma bolt will shoot
straight through it.
NEW WORKER
No shit?
6.
Quaid allows a slight grin as he holds up his own hand and
shows him A ROUND SCAR in the center of his palm. The
Worker quickly jerks his hand away from the synth.
NEW WORKER
Thanks.
Quaid briefly nods.
FAR ACROSS THE FACTORY FLOOR we see a scrawny MAN enter:
your typical middle-management type, his gait stiff and
awkward. He approaches the Foreman, asks him something.
The Foreman nods, points all the way across the floor...
to where Quaid and Harry are working.
INT. FACTORY OFFICE - MANAGEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY
Quaid waiting outside a door, when it opens and Harry
emerges. Harry makes brief eye contact with Quaid as he
passes, rolling his eyes.
HARRY
Strap yourself in - this guy’s a laugh a
minute.
MAN (O.S.)
(stiff)
Mr. Quaid?
INT. FACTORY OFFICE
The man from the factory floor now sits behind a desk,
glancing up to find Quaid in the doorway.
BERGEN
Ted Bergen, Human Resources division.
Come in.
Quaid does. Bergen exhibits the warmth of a dead fish,
and only slightly more personality:
BERGEN
I understand you and your friend were on
the glide-train platform when that
explosion occurred.
(off Quaid’s guarded look)
You were inventoried by your train’s ID
scanner, naturally we were alerted...
QUAID
Right - of course.
7.
BERGEN
The company thought it prudent for me to
check in. I imagine the incident must
have been - unnerving.
QUAID
You could say that. I’m fine though. My
wife was more shaken up about it, and
she’s halfway around the world.
Bergen briefly nods, opening a file on his desk.
BERGEN
Now then, you’ve been employed here
almost 6 years now... And you live in New
Asia?
QUAID
(nods)
Like most workers I make the commute.
BERGEN
And you’re assigned to the assembly
division. That’s skilled labor...
QUAID
True. Though it’s still work a machine
could do. Truth is if it wasn’t for the
Automation Restriction Act, I wouldn’t
have a job. For that matter, either
would you, right?
Bergen frowns, confused. Quaid cracks a smile.
QUAID
No humans, no Human Resources.
Bergen returns an insincere half-smile, then resumes his
perusing of Quaid’s file.
BERGEN
And do you like working here, Mr. Quaid?
QUAID
Does it matter?
Bergen glances up, clearly was expecting a rote “yes.”
BERGEN
No, I - suppose not.
(clears his throat)
Now then, about the incident you
witnessed this morning...
(reading from paperwork)
8.
It’s my duty as an employee of a federal
conglomerate to gauge the extent of your
sympathies to the New Asian insurgency,
and by extension any possible involvement
you may have had in this morning’s
attack. I’ve also been instructed to
determine whether you’re suffering any
residual shock or stress that could
affect your workplace productivity.
Bergen peers up at Quaid.
BERGEN
So are you?
QUAID
Sorry - are you asking if I’m a
terrorist, or if I’m just freaked out?
BERGEN
Either -- well, both.
QUAID
No, and no.
Bergen scribbles in his file. Seconds tick by. Quaid
just standing here.
QUAID
Is there anything else, or can I resume
my workplace productivity?
Bergen glances up, thrown by Quaid’s polite smile masking
his sarcasm.
BERGEN
Yes - I mean no - nothing else. For now.
INT. FACTORY - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY
Less crowded than before, workers preparing to head home,
Quaid and Harry among them.
HARRY
If you ask me, it’s bullshit,
interrogating us just because we’re from
New Asia.
Quaid notices a CLEAN-UP CREW OF THREE EMPLOYEES emptying
out that locker tagged “MARCUS.”
HARRY
You heard what happened to him, right?
9.
BERGEN (CONT'D)
QUAID
Marcus? No, was he transferred?
HARRY
Yeah. To the psych ward. Not that he
was the picture of sanity to begin with.
QUAID
What happened?
HARRY
Mind-tripping. Turns out he was pretty
hooked. Couldn’t get enough.
Quaid is surprised, but also vaguely intrigued.
HARRY
You always hear people going on about how
it’s this amazing experience, expands
your mind - and that it’s all perfectly
safe. Yeah? Then why’s it illegal?
(SLAM his locker shut)
Trust me, I don’t care what the thrill
is, it ain’t worth it.
Harry turns to Quaid. Ready to go.
HARRY
You coming, Dougie?
QUAID
In a sec. I’ll meet you out front.
Harry makes for the exit. Quaid finishes gathering his
things, grabs his old spy paperback and shuts his locker -
- to find co-worker Murphy standing beside him.
MURPHY
Marcus was a whack job, that’s why he
flipped. Trust me, Quaid, a mind-trip’s
everything they say it is and more.
QUAID
You’ve done it?
MURPHY
(lowers his voice, grins)
Been to Mars three times already - made
first contact with the aliens, they treat
me like a king. Best memories I have.
10.
QUAID
And that’s all it is? An artificial
memory?
MURPHY
Artificial or not, man, it feels real.
Matter of fact it’s more than real.
Because it doesn’t fade. You remember
every last detail.
(shuts his own locker)
I’ll tell you this much -
Murphy grabs his bag and starts to go.
MURPHY
Makes the days around here go by a whole
lot faster.
He grins again, and walks off to join others leaving.
HOLD ON QUAID ALONE, thinking about what Murphy’s just
said, eyes drifting back to Marcus’ emptied locker -
- when he notices something on the floor nearby: A SMALL
SCRAP OF PAPER that must have escaped the clean-up crew.
Quaid looks around - only a couple of workers left, none
paying attention to him.
Quaid bends down, picks up the scrap. Turns it over to
see four words scribbled: “RECALL your Wildest Dreams.”
Below it two more words: “INDUSTRY / PRODUCTION.”
Quaid frowns, his pulse quickening. He again peers
around, no one observing him. He hesitates a beat, then
pockets the scrap.
EXT. TRAIN - EUROMERICA - DAY
Winding through the 13th Level of the city - marvelous in
its geometric perfection. Neatly ordered, meticulously
clean ...
BUT CROWDED. Dense throngs of Euromerica’s uniformly
prosperous population packing every upward-rising walkway.
EXT. CHINA FALL - DAY
Quaid and Harry disembark the train onto the loading
platform of a TERMINAL teeming with THOUSANDS OF WORKERS.
Towering above it all - a GARGANTUAN UPRIGHT CYLINDER of
heavily reinforced steel and glass - 30 STORIES TALL.
11.
At it’s apex, English, Arabic, Chinese and Cyrillic
characters blink round its crown ...
THE CHINA FALL.
INT. CHINA FALL - UPPER PASSENGER DECKS - DAY
Quaid and Harry sit on the upper deck, looking through
heat-shielded windows at the thronging terminal far below.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Ni-hao. Hola. Privyet. Welcome to the
China Fall. Travel time to New Asia - 17
minutes. Dropping - in 60 seconds.
As the voice repeats in Russian, roller-coaster like
RESTRAINTS lock down over Quaid and Harry’s shoulders.
On the SCREEN in the seat-back ahead, a NEWSCAST: on it
CHANCELLOR VILOS COHAAGEN (identified by the crawl below)
responding to the attack. He speaks with a measured tone,
impressing us as a voice of reason and concern:
COHAAGEN (ON NEWS)
It is delusion to think of our world as
it was. The Hemispheric Wars changed
everything. It left 7/8’s of our planet
uninhabitable. But we survived and
adapted, united under a single
government, dedicated to building a
better future.
Quaid watches wearily, his paperback open on his knee.
Beside him, Harry’s already fallen asleep.
COHAAGEN (ON NEWS)
Yet to live in close quarters means we
cannot afford to tolerate any individuals
who would seek to disrupt the balance of
society.
Abruptly a massive THUNK reverberates the entire
structure. Quaid pays no mind, as outside the windows
MASSIVE BOLTS - anchoring the top of the CHINA FALL -
suddenly PNEUMATICALLY WITHDRAW.
COHAAGEN (ON NEWS)
These are trying times, and while I
maintain that our Zero Immigration Policy
remains a necessity, Euromerica is
committed to improving the lives of those
living in the colony of New Asia. It’s
why we instituted the Automation
12.
Restriction Laws, so that New Asia’s
workers can remain employed without fear
of being replaced by machines.
The Cohaagen audio becomes fainter beneath the din:
COHAAGEN (ON NEWS)
But we will not permit Quatto and his
minions to intimidate us - Quatto, a man
afraid to show his own face.
CROPPED INSET ON SCREEN is a file photo of a smallish,
INDIAN MAN with glasses, mostly obscured by shadow.
COHAAGEN (V.O.)
He’d have you believe it’s to preserve
anonymity. I assure you it is mere
cowardice. His followers consider him
some sort of messiah, when he is in fact
no more than a murderer.
And the EARTH - the concrete reality of the LOADING
PLATFORMS, with all the gathered worker-commuters, begins
to rise up at shocking speed to MEET the windows.
As if Quaid is in the top floor of a building coming down
in an earthquake...
COHAAGEN (ON NEWS)
(barely audible)
Quatto may think that by increasing his
attacks, he’s instilling fear. But our
resolve is stronger than ever...
His PAPERBACK next to him begins to FLOAT - weightless.
But he pays it no mind as the Loading Platform comes - and
goes - flashing past. And the entire 30 stories of the
China Fall, gathering speed...
Drops into the earth. Outside - the blue skies and beauty
of Euromerica are replaced with levels of an UNDERGROUND
MALL flashing past. Until they too abruptly vanish ...
As the massive China Fall enters the reinforced SHAFT
built for it... directly through the earth.
Quaid’s eyelids lose the battle. He too drifts off to
sleep.
INT. CHINA FALL
And abruptly WAKENS. Around him, many of his fellow
commuters are yawning awake from catnaps.
13.
COHAAGEN (ON NEWS) 
PUBLIC ADDRESS
... core ... passing - through core ...
passing - through core ...
Harry’s still out cold. Quaid glances out the heatshielded
windows. The walls of the SHAFT, glowing WHITE
HOT - are rocketing past.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Core traversed. Gravity - reversing.
Quaid yawns - unperturbed - as the floating PAPERBACK
beside him starts to travel up towards the ceiling, and
his seat, begins to slowly ORBIT upward along the CIRCULAR
TRACK it is mounted to ...
Until he - and every other commuter in the packed car has
completed a 180 degree rotation - and now SITS ON WHAT
BEGAN THE TRIP AS THE CEILING.
Outside, the walls of the shaft begin cooling to red -
And the China Fall begins rising ...
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Pressurizing for sea-level New Asia. You
may experience - some discomfort.
Up towards the surface of the other side of the earth.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Passenger arrival in - 8 minutes.
EXT. CHINA FALL PASSENGER PLATFORM - NEW ASIA - DUSK
Murky skies over New Asia. LOADING PLATFORM, crowded.
CHILDREN - urchins - play atop massive grates that
surround the platform in the tremendous volumetric updraft
of AIR rising up out of them.
Abruptly, the torrents of oxygen cease, hair and clothing
settling, as a gasping mechanical WHOOSH precedes a GREAT
METAL MAW grinding open in the center of the platform ...
And - gentle as a sparrow alighting - the massiveness of
the CHINA FALL rises into sight ... All thirty stories
climbing upward out of the earth ... until it reaches the
exhaustion of the kinetic energy it had gained from
falling thru the center of the earth.
MASSIVE BOLTS clunking inward on all sides - catching...
and locking it into place.
14.
EXT. NEW ASIA PASSENGER PLATFORM - DUSK
Exiting, Quaid and Harry pause as AIR rushing out of the
China Fall blows GARBAGE across the LITTER STREWN
platform.
Even though it’s dawn here - the sky is DARK from choking
clouds of SMOKE, SMOG and CHEMICAL GAS ...
Belching up from the endless SMOKESTACKS of the FACTORIES
that stretch away as far as the human eye can see. A
LIGHT ACID RAIN begins to sting the platform - tiny curls
of acidic smoke rising where every drop strikes.
Quaid and Harry pay it no mind. They’re used to it. They
live here.
INT. BUS - EVENING
An old first-gen bus - liberally graffitied with slogans:
‘Quatto’s RIGHT!’, ‘New Asia got the SHAFT!’
Outside, the garbage-strewn sidewalks and soot-covered
tenements roll by with their constituency, the dull-eyed
workforce of the world ...
While within, QUAID sits with Harry, staring uneasily at a
BUS AD across the aisle: “MIND-TRIPPING: A ONE-WAY TICKET
TO A LIVING HELL.” However someone has crossed out “HELL”
and scrawled “HEAVEN.”
From a heavily abused screen set into the back of the
driver’s seat, Cohaagen’s speech is being re-played:
COHAAGEN (ON NEWS)
...in close quarters means we simply can
not afford to tolerate any individuals
who would seek to disrupt the balanceYOUNG
WOMAN (O.S.)
(behind them)
There is no balance.
Quaid and Harry glance behind them to find an earnest,
intellectual YOUNG WOMAN. Harry rolls his eyes at Quaid.
In no mood.
YOUNG WOMAN
We have a right to live just as well here
as they do in Euromerica. But if that
ever happened, we’d no longer be content
to work for them. So instead of building
us up, they build the China Fall, and
15.
shackle us to it. Ship us like cattle to
the other end of the Earth, where
residents can actually breathe the air -
HARRY
Give it a rest, huh? Nobody’s interested.
QUAID
(more polite)
We’ve had a long day.
YOUNG WOMAN
But don’t you see - Cohaagen is counting
on your complacency. He can’t risk us
waking up to the truth. Quatto’s rightHARRY
(harder)
Hey! I said knock if off.
The Young Woman falls quiet as the bus makes a stop. She
rises and starts for the door, glancing back at Quaid:
YOUNG WOMAN
The resistance is real. Join us.
A few other passengers eye her uneasily as she exits the
bus, the DOORS SHUTTING behind her.
Quaid observes her through his grimy window as she remains
on the street, looking both brave and helpless, her figure
smaller and smaller as the bus zooms away.
INT. QUAID’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Quaid enters. Passes a woman’s PARAMEDIC UNIFORM draped
over a chair, a medical kit beside it. He proceeds into
THE KITCHEN
Empties his pockets onto the table. Pausing on the SCRAP
OF PAPER he’d pocketed earlier... re-reads “RECALL your
Wildest Dreams!”
VOICE
Doug?
He looks up as his wife LORI enters. Blonde, beautiful,
intelligent and warm. She is dressed for bed. Subtly,
Quaid quickly slips the scrap of paper back into his
pocket as Lori hurries over and embraces him.
16.
YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
QUAID
Honey, I told you. I’m fine.
LORI
You’re sure? They had our unit on
standby. I was trying to get them to
send us...
She hugs him tighter, plants a big kiss.
LORI
I’m just so glad you’re okay. It must
have been awful.
She catches the way his smile falters.
LORI
What is it?
QUAID
Nothing, I just... Those people on that
train - they were just like me. On their
way to some mindless job, not realizing
it could all end in an instant. I kept
thinking, if I died today, would it even
matter?
Lori glances back at him, knows where this is going.
LORI
Doug...
She shakes her head - they’ve gone down this road before.
QUAID
(lets it go)
Nevermind. I’m sorry.
LORI
If you’re not happy at work, why don’t
you ask for that promotion we’ve talked
about?
QUAID
It’s not that. I don’t know - I just
wish my life had more of a purpose, you
know?
LORI
Oh baby - don’t say that.
(sighs)
Look, you know I think it’s a good thing
to have aspirations. I just think you
need to be realistic, that’s all. You
17.
have a steady job that you’re good at...
isn’t that purpose enough?
She crosses to him.
LORI
You do matter. To me. So what if my
husband isn’t all those starry-eyed
things he promised years ago when we
first were dating...
She loops her arms around his neck.
LORI
Doug - I never cared about any of that.
I only care about my man and whether he’s
content.
Her fingers drift down his face.
LORI
Because if he’s not, then I’m not doing
my job.
He gazes back into her eyes, smile finding its way back to
his own lips. He reaches to touch her face...
But she drops away.
LORI
I’ve got to get some sleep. Got such an
early day tomorrow.
(blows him a kiss)
Love ya...
And pads down the hall. Leaving him watching after.
INT. QUAID’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Standing in the doorway, he watches as his wife sleeps.
The clock reads: 10:30 PM.
INT. QUAID’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
At the decrepit PIANO, Quaid tinkles a MELANCHOLY MELODY.
His spy novel rests on the piano top.
TIGHT ON QUAID, mind wandering as he plays...
FLASH ON: THAT ALMOST DREAM-LIKE VISION OF MELINA on the
platform, leaning over Quaid with a gentle smile -
18.
LORI (CONT'D)
Quaid stops playing, stares off a beat. Antsy, pensive.
Off his look --
INT. BAR - NEW ASIA - NIGHT
Quaid - DRIPPING WET - presents himself at the grimy bar.
HARRY is already there, a local beer ahead.
HARRY
Glad you called, I needed a beer after
the day we’ve had...
(Quaid nods)
Lori working tonight?
QUAID
(doesn’t want to get into
it)
Yeah.
(signals Bartender)
Beer.
HARRY
You’re a lucky man, Quaid. Gals like
Lori don’t drop outta thin air, you know?
Quaid nods halfheartedly, then looks up at his friend.
QUAID
I keep thinking about that woman on the
platform this morning.
HARRY
What woman?
QUAID
You must’ve seen her. She was there
right before you got to me. Dark hair,
beautiful...
Harry just shrugs, shakes his head - never saw her.
QUAID
I had this weird feeling when I saw her.
Like I knew her somehow.
HARRY
(frowns)
Dougie, please tell me you’re not
thinking of doing something stupid.
QUAID
What? No. It’s just...
19.
HARRY
What?
QUAID
(exhales; looks up)
Do you ever wish things could be
different?
HARRY
(smirks)
No.
QUAID
(challenging)
You’re actually content with the way your
life’s turned out?
HARRY
(stung)
Why the hell shouldn’t I be? Something
wrong with it?
Quaid realizes he’s struck a nerve.
HARRY
You know what your problem is? You
haven’t surrendered yet. And until you
do - until you accept that you’re never
gonna change the world, that you’re just
a regular guy from the wrong side of the
Shaft whose future is gonna be what it’s
gonna be and there ain’t a damn thing you
can do about it...
(nods)
Until you can accept that, you’re never
gonna appreciate the gorgeous wife and
life you got right now. You want my
advice? You better find a way to deal
with whatever the hell you’re dealing
with before you fuck it all up.
Harry sees Quaid is taking the lecture to heart.
QUAID
Lori says I need to be realistic.
HARRY
Well, she’s right. I mean sure, reality
sucks sometimes, but at least it’s real.
Quaid cracks a slight smile at his friend’s clunky
aphorism. Harry raises his glass.
20.
HARRY
To real reality. I’ll take it any day.
Quaid hesitates. Then raises his own glass.
QUAID
To real reality.
As Quaid downs his beer, we hold on his expression -
EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NEW ASIA - NIGHT (LATER)
Quaid walking along bustling streets of suspended
catwalks, the polluted sky in the background casting a
hazy glow. It’s obvious from the way Quaid’s eyes dart
that he’s never been to this part of town before.
And in his hand we see he’s clutching that slip of paper.
Eyes still roving, he finally halts, peering up
uncertainly at something above him...
REVEAL he’s standing directly beneath the crossroads of
two battered STREET SIGNS: “INDUSTRY” and “PRODUCTION.”
Quaid peers back down at the slip of paper in his hand...
RECALL Your Wildest Dreams! INDUSTRY / PRODUCTION
The acidic rain wets the paper, causing the ink to run in
viscous, psychedelic swirls.
TIGHT ON QUAID: moment of decision. He looks unsure as,
down a dark stairway, he can hear the distant din of
MUSIC...
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
Quaid stops at a steel door protected by the massive girth
of a giant sphinx of a MAN. Quaid swallows -
- then shows the giant Man the slip of paper.
The Man studies it a beat, then wordlessly opens the door
to a world of LIGHT AND SOUND.
INT. UNDERGROUND CLUB - NIGHT
Quaid emerges into the pulsating flash and din of an
UNDERGROUND CLUB. This is no Corporate Tavern.
21.
The first music we’ve heard. The first PEOPLE we’ve seen
laughing; smiling ... They seem truly alive. Free.
Quaid pushes through to the bar where he yells something
to the bartender, but it’s inaudible beneath the pulsing
music. Quaid reaches into his pocket, shows the Bartender
the same slip of paper.
The Bartender considers Quaid, then allows a slight grin.
INT. ROOM - NIGHT
Quaid stops in a dim room. Numerous LOCKS clicking into
place as the heavy door clunks closed behind him.
INCENSE burns. In the dim light Quaid can make out the
trappings of a makeshift high-tech lab.
VOICE
How do I know you’re not a cop?
He spins. A FIGURE stands in the shadows.
QUAID
I’m just a bot-line worker.
A man (MCCLANE) - bearded - steps out into the light.
Eyes him.
MCCLANE
No one is ‘just’ what they appear.
Quaid narrows.
QUAID
What’s that supposed to mean?
Ignoring the question, McClane perches on the edge of a
battered old desk. Studies Quaid.
QUAID
(turns to go)
You know what? This was probably a
mistake. I’m just gonna go...
MCCLANE
And stay awake til dawn, wondering what
you missed?
(smiles)
Look, you came here for a reason, right?
Quaid pauses, can’t argue that.
22.
MCCLANE
First thing you need to know is, there’s
nothing to be scared of. Half the people
in this club have mind-tripped. They
look particularly miserable to you?
Quaid barely shakes his head.
QUAID
How does it work exactly?
MAN
Simple chemistry, Mr...
QUAID
Quaid. Doug Quaid.
MCCLANE
Tell me, Doug, what is life but our
brain’s chemical perception of it? Your
eyes see; your brain chemistry reacts.
Here we simply remove the middle-man and
go straight to the chemistry. Does that
make it any less real?
McClane drops into the seat behind a desk.
MCCLANE
Anything you want to experience - you
can. You’re limited only by your own
imagination. It can be something you
could never afford to actually do. Or
something secret you’ve always wanted to
do, but would never dare...
(nods)
We can remember it for you. An ultravivid
recollection of your very own.
QUAID
What do you mean by secret...?
MCCLANE
Anything. It’s your fantasy. Want to be
rich and famous and worshipped by
millions? Or maybe something with a
little more adrenaline. Like a crimefighter.
Or a world-class athlete.
Quaid smiles faintly.
MCCLANE
Or maybe leader of an underground
revolutionary group? Lots of cute,
misguided little anarchist groupies
23.
running around? Or a jewel thief - with
secret bank accounts, coded messages.
QUAID
(debating)
... What about a spy?
McClane blinks. A faint smile comes to his lips.
MCCLANE
Sure. You mean intelligence operative.
Secretly working for the Resistance. Or
maybe for Cohaagen?
(a smile)
Or why limit yourself? Why not both?
He hits a panel and behind him the WALL OPENS, revealing a
‘pipe-organ’ of LIQUID-FILLED GLASS CANISTERS, each one a
soaring column of multi-colored CHEMICALS.
MCCLANE
Welcome to the revolution, Doug - freeing
the world - one mind at a time.
He hits a key on the computer.
MCCLANE
You’ll go through your life knowing a
secret that no one else has a clue about.
That your real life is just a cover.
That you’re really an agent of the
highest security classification. Secret
missions; secret identities...
He spins the screen. An ARRAY OF FUTURISTIC WEAPONRY.
MCCLANE
... secret weapons ...
(a smile)
Gonna need some firepower, right?
Quaid eyes the selection. He swallows.
QUAID
Okay, uh - that one, I guess.
He types it in. PNEUMATICS - as liquid begins to pump from
several columns - recombining in a CENTRAL SYRINGE.
MCCLANE
And tell me, Doug - are you a loner ...?
(looks over)
Or are you a man who likes ‘company’?
24.
MCCLANE (CONT'D)
Quaid hesitates.
QUAID
Actually, I’m married, so...
MCCLANE
(a sly smile)
All the more reason to get creative.
It’s your memory, Doug. Why not have a
little fun?
Quaid hesitates again. Swallows. Then nods.
MCCLANE
Atta boy. Brunette? Blon...
QUAID
(immediately)
Brunette. Athletic build. Very pretty.
MCCLANE
Wow. Knows what he likes too. Something
along these lines, Doug?
He spins the screen. The WOMAN being constructed on it
looks vaguely familiar. Somewhat like, maybe, MELINA?
QUAID
Um. Yeah. Sure.
MCCLANE
The chemicals affect everyone
differently. Your mind will supply the
details that suit it best.
Finishing, he smiles expansively as he removes the SYRINGE
- with its golden contents - from the receptacle - he
holds it up, glinting in the light.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Quaid trails McClane down a murky hallway.
MCCLANE
One last thing. As a matter of full
disclosure, none of the secret life
elements you chose ...
(glances over his shoulder)
... can actually be true.
Quaid cocks his head.
25.
MCCLANE
Truth is, lots of fellas come in wanting
the secret mistress trip when the greedy
bastards have already got one - a real
one - on the side.
(shakes head)
Can’t do that. It would cause
irreparable conflict and confusion.
That’s how brains get blown.
QUAID
Trust me, I don’t have any secret
mistresses.
MCCLANE
Sure Doug. Don’t doubt you for a second.
(smiles)
But we’re going to run a full psychopolygraphic
panel on you anyway. For
your own safety.
INT. TRIPPING DEN - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
McClane leads Quaid down a freaky HALLWAY. POUNDING MUSIC
as they pass stragglers with endless piercings. Quaid
spots Murphy from work, talking up a PROSTITUTE surgicallyenhanced
so that she has three breasts...
MCCLANE
This way, Doug.
Quaid follows McClane into
INT. TRIPPING DEN - DIMLY LIT ROOM
At the center is a HEAVILY FUTURISTIC CHAIR.
McClane steps aside. Quaid hesitates. Then sits into it.
A BOHEMIAN YOUNG WOMAN with dreadlocks places SENSORS on
his forehead, while McClane starts an attached computer.
He types in commands while the young nurse straps Quaid’s
arm to the chair, swabs the vein in the crook of his
elbow.
She then takes out a small, futuristic PUNCH-GUN, brings
it to the skin and THWACK! punches a sort of tattoo of a
PEACE SYMBOL.
26.
Quaid winces as she proceeds to then use the cross-hairs
within the Peace symbol as a bullseye into which she now
inserts a CATHETER needle.
MCCLANE
Sorry. Still no better way to get
chemicals into a human body.
A FULL SPECTRUM of vital statistics blooms out in a
holographic jellyfish around Quaid.
McClane consults the data. Grins.
MCCLANE
Looks like your wife does have a man who
appreciates her, Doug. No conflict there.
QUAID
I’m a lousy liar. I don’t even try.
McClane smiles.
MCCLANE
Good quality to have, Doug. Let’s get
this show on the road then.
McClane nods to the nurse who flips the cap off the
SYRINGE and inserts the needle through the membrane,
injecting its contents into the IV.
Quaid watches as GOLDEN FLUID floods into the intravenous
tube - creeping down towards his arm.
Calm expression betrayed by his holographic vitals - BPM,
EKG, O2 - which begin to pulse and spike anxiously.
QUAID
How long does it take?
MCCLANE
It’ll be here before you -
(halts; eyeing the vitals)
Wait, what the...
QUAID
(slightly uneasy)
What is it?
McClane ignores him, quickly checking something on his
computer screens. Quaid anxiously regards the golden
syrup DISAPPEARING from the clear tube, traveling down
into the BLACKENED LENGTH OF TUBE leading toward the vein
in the back of his hand.
27.
MCCLANE
No...
Abruptly, the holographic vitals go CRAZY.
MCCLANE
SHIT!
Spins on the young woman -
MCCLANE
Quick! Yank that needle before the
implant takes!
The young woman rips the needle out of McClane’s elbow -
GOLDEN LIQUID spraying everywhere.
QUAID
What is it? What’s wrong?
His eyes leap to Quaid - wide as saucers.
MCCLANE
You...
He staggers back a step.
MCCLANE
You lied.
And to Quaid’s utter astonishment - from the small of his
back, he pulls a PISTOL - aiming it between Quaid’s eyes.
MCCLANE
The sonofabitch lied to us!
QUAID
No! I swear! I don’t have a mistress!
MCCLANE
Mistress!?! You’re a goddam spy!
QUAID
What?!
MCCLANE
The psych-panel is never wrong! You
really are an intelligence agent! You’re
here to bust us - you son of a bitch!
Quickly, he CHAMBERS a bullet - swinging the gun on
Quaid...
28.
QUAID
No! I’m not a spy!
BAM! the DOOR suddenly bursts open ...
SENTRY 1
FEDERAL POLICE! NO ONE MOVE!!!
ROOM suddenly streaming with BODY-ARMORED TERROR SENTRIES
NURSE
It’s a raid!
McClane’s startled shot goes WIDE - killing her dead ...
MCCLANE
(Quaid)
You sonofabitch!
He turns to run - but is GUNNED down in his tracks.
A SECOND NURSE screams and tries to run and is likewise
stitched with bullets, going crashing into the machinery.
SENTRY 2
There he is! That’s him!
The Sentry gestures to Quaid - instantly, all the MACHINE
GUNS turn to Quaid who is on his feet, hands in the air.
QUAID
Don’t shoot!
SENTRY 1
Knees! Now!
A second Sentry shoves him to his knees.
QUAID
Please! This is all a mistake!
Behind him a pistol is shoved into the back of his skull.
QUAID
Don’t! I’m just a bot line worker!
SENTRY 3
Yeah right.
QUAID
I swear -
29.
SENTRY 2
(jams his pistol harder)
Open your mouth again and you’re dead.
Quaid’s arms are yanked violently behind his head, the
Sentry about to slap on flex-cuffs when
Quaid MOVES like we’d have never expected - grabbing the
gun, he yanks the man’s arm forward across his shoulder
and wrenches it down, Sentry shrieking as the splintering
of his bone rifle-shots thru the room.
Instantly, Quaid is on his feet and as the screaming man
reflexively compresses the trigger on the automatic pistol
- Quaid sends it spitting round the room, catching stunned
Sentries marionetting in its fire.
Finishing by yanking the gun out of the Sentry’s hand and
blowing him off his feet.
Leaving Quaid standing in a sudden RINGING SILENCE ...
Pall of smoke hanging in the room ... GUN red-hot and
smoking in his hand amidst a ROOMFUL OF BODIES.
Stunned - he can’t believe it.
QUAID
(breathless)
Holy shit...
SOUNDS - more Sentries coming barreling up the stairs.
INT. HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE
The SECOND WAVE OF SENTRIES nearing the top of the stairs.
One of them grips a futuristic walkie-talkie:
SENTRY 3
Team One, have you secured the suspect?
No response. The second wave Sentries peer up to see
QUAID DOWN THE HALL with the half-open door -
They charge down the hallway, OPENING FIRE... as Quaid
skids to the door and SLAMS IT SHUT.
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM
REVERSE ON QUAID as he bolts the lock and quickly drops
back as immediately bullets begin tearing at the door.
Quaid’s eyes dart, looking for any sort of escape route -
30.
- when the gunfire comes to a halt. A walkie on one of
the DEAD SENTRIES lying nearby squawks:
SENTRY 3 (ON RADIO)
Team One, advise.
Quaid continues searching for a way out. No windows.
Suddenly hears the sound of nearing footfall, he whips
back to
THE BULLET-RIDDEN DOOR. Through the holes he makes out
the SHADOWS of the Second Wave Sentries coming closer...
Quaid needs to think fast --
EXT. HALLWAY
The Sentries making for the door when OVER THEIR WALKIES:
QUAID (O.S./ON WALKIE)
Anyone comes through that door, the rest
of your men in here die!
Immediately the LEAD SENTRY throws up a hand and the
entire team halts.
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM
Quaid gripping the walkie, eyes darting, desperate for an
exit...
EXT. HALLWAY
The team held up out here, their anxious eyes on the Lead
Sentry.
LEAD SENTRY
(hushed)
Stevens, get an eyeball in there now!
INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM
Quaid trying to figure his next move when -
BRWWHUMP! A FIST-SIZED HOLE blows through the door, minimissile
WHISTLING across the room, burying itself
anchoring into the wall...
Quaid only has time to clock the fact that it seems to be
winding up like a clock just before it...
31.
EXPLODES - sending a shrapnel-cloud of smaller projectiles
stabbing into every surface around the room.
Including QUAID’S OWN HANDS - that he’d raised to protect
his face. Now finding himself staring at a TINY CAMERA
projecting out of his flesh - dialing focus - like all the
other ‘shrapnel cameras’ around him...
His eyes leap to the HOLE blown in the door - thru which -
he can just see a Sentry ...
Unrolling from his vest a FLEX-SCREEN, a veritable quilt
of nearly 100 individual video feeds and Quaid realizes -
SENTRY’S VOICE
They’re all down! He’s alone!
That the feeds are from INSIDE the room.
LEAD SENTRY (O.S.)
Break it down!
Panic. Quaid spins - eyes falling on an anti-personnel
grenade still on the flak vest of a fallen Sentry.
Diving, he yanks the pin and - rolling clear, topples a
steel cabinet collapsing down on top of the body as it...
EXPLODES - blasting a HUGE HOLE through the floor, the
heavy cabinet now tipping in, creating an impromptu slide
down to the level below...
Quaid rolling in as the ROOM’S DOOR blows off, SENTRIES
streaming in the room, pursuing Quaid down into ...
INT. BASEMENT - SAME
Catching sight of Quaid fleeing through a floor grate into
an air shaft, Sentries bullets spark after him...
INT. AIR SHAFT
Quaid scrape-falls eighteen feet, slamming down on the
bottom grate, which...
BUSTS - swinging open - leaving him DANGLING above the
city below. Hanging in a kind of alley suspended beneath
the city block...
Above Quaid can hear the shouts and sounds of Sentries.
Coming. And worse, blinding SEARCHLIGHTS from behind as a
massive POLICE HARRIER hovers into frame.
32.
Fighting with everything he has, Quaid makes a swing for
the CATWALK lining the side of the alley. Misses ...
Swings again - just catches it. Pulls himself over by his
fingertips and - as Sentries begin making their way down
thru the blast hole...
Disappears.
INT. QUAID’S APARTMENT - DAWN
When Quaid enters, LORI is on the phone as she buttons up
her paramedic’s uniform. Seeing Quaid ...
LORI
(into phone)
Yes. I understand.
She hangs up. Studies Quaid a moment.
LORI
I was worried. Where were you?
QUAID
I ... couldn’t sleep. Went for a walk.
She gives him a probing look. Then continues dressing -
LORI
There’s been some sort of attack. Here
in New Asia. They have me on standby.
QUAID
What - sort of attack?
LORI
Sounds like one of Quatto’s terrorists
shot up a whole squadron of Federal
Police at some nightclub.
She heads into the bedroom. Quaid looks after, helpless -
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Quaid stops in the doorway, watching Lori pack her gear.
The NEWS is on, MUTED: a REPORTER is standing before the
entrance to the nightclub, now swarming with Emergency
vehicles and Federal Police.
QUAID
Lori...
33.
LORI
(distracted; packing gear)
Hm?
QUAID
What if... what if Quatto wasn’t
responsible for that attack?
She turns. Looks at him.
LORI
Doug, they said it was a total slaughter.
Who else would be capable of something
like that?
In the doorway, Quaid stands silent.
QUAID
Lori, I...
(shakes head)
It wasn’t the Resistance who killed those
sentries.
Her brow furrows - what’s he talking about?
QUAID
It wasn’t a terrorist act.
Quaid looks like he wants to die.
QUAID
It was me.
She blinks at him.
LORI
What was you?
QUAID
Me. Me ... I did it.
LORI
You did what?
QUAID
Those Sentries. The Resistance didn’t
kill them...
(nods)
I did.
She holds on him a second. Then stifles a laugh.
34.
LORI
You. Killed an entire squadron of highly
trained Federal Police.
QUAID
I know how it sounds but... I found this
slip of paper at work -
Shows her the slip; she recognizes at once what it means:
LORI
Doug, you went to those brain butchers?!
QUAID
I know it was a mistake - I just wanted
to try it - only this guy, he started
accusing me of being someone - and they
burst in and I just reacted and then...
then the next thing I knew -
(devastated)
- everyone was dead.
She regards him a deadpan beat, then shakes her head.
LORI
Oh Doug, Doug - don’t you see? Whatever
it is you think you did...
(gestures to news image)
... it has nothing to do with this.
Those bastards must’ve screwed up your
mind. You’re having some sort of
paranoid delusion...
QUAID
It was no delusion, Lori. It was real!
LORI
(scoffs)
Doug, think about what you’re...
Her words trail off as her eyes narrow on something behind
Quaid: the NEWS REPORT.
She’s turning pale as she quickly un-mutes the screen:
TELEVISION REPORTER
...believe that this recovered freezeframe
depicts the as-yet unidentified man
responsible for the slayings.
The picture enlarges, revealing a heavily-pixelated man
who could indeed be Quaid.
35.
ON LORI, stunned, she slowly turns back to Quaid. He
returns a grave expression as the news drones on:
TELEVISION REPORTER
Rumors are already circulating that this
individual could be none other than Carl
Hauser, the former Intelligence Officer
turned Quatto operational leader who has
been implicated in many of these recent
attacks, however Federal Police have yet
to confirm...
QUAID
Lori - I’m so sorry...
His eyes nearly mist. She holds on him another moment -
feeling for him. Then crosses the room to him.
LORI
Doug - whatever happened, we’re going to
get through this.
(taking him to her)
C’mere...
Quaid melts into her - grateful to feel human compassion.
QUAID
It all happened so fast, I just reacted.
God knows what they’ll do to me -
LORI
(stroking his hair)
Shh - it’s okay. We’ll figure out what
to do...
It is a moment - swimming in her embrace - before he ...
must tug at her arm round his neck ...
QUAID
Lori ... Lori ... that’s ...
(choking)
...I can’t... can’t breathe ...
But her arms - he suddenly realizes - have slipped into a
NAKED CHOKE and his face goes red as he struggles to fight
her off. But grimly determined, she just holds him in a
DEATH-GRIP - as if her personality has suddenly
transformed into a bad-ass femme-fatale killing machine.
Abruptly, he FLIPS her over his back, sending her slamming
into the floor.
Instantly - like a cat - she is up - ferocious - fighting
stance as he coughs, trying to regain his breath.
36.
QUAID
(gasping)
Lori!?! What the fu--
She kicks him in the head, sending it snapping sideways.
QUAID
Lori!
She spins again - but this time - to her surprise - and
his - he catches the kick mid-air.
They both hover a frozen instant ...
Then he sweeps her legs - hurling her backward. She whips
around, reaches into her paramedic’s kit - and pulls out A
GUN?
Quaid gapes in utter shock - then bolts out of the room -
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Diving into the kitchen as her gun ...
Booming like a CANNON ...
Blows MASSIVE HOLES following him through the wall.
Hitting the lights, he rolls to a crouch in the darkness.
QUAID
Lori! Goddamit! What are you doing??
LORI - creeping, gun tight to her beautiful cheek, through
the darkness -
LORI
My job.
QUAID
Have you gone crazy?!
LORI
Me?
(laughs low)
That’s a good one, Doug. Considering you
don’t even know who the hell you are.
In the shadows, Quaid stops. What?
LORI
Do you really believe a factory worker
could take out an entire room of highly
37.
trained men? Doesn’t that strike you as
just a little bit strange?
A beat of heart-pounding silence as we go TIGHT ON QUAID,
his mind finally forced to confront this implausibility.
The implications shake him to his core...
QUAID
The guy in the trip-den said I was some
kind of spy. Is that what’s going on
here? Lori?
In the dark, Lori smiles to herself.
QUAID
Damn it Lori - answer me!
Abruptly, QUAID comes lunging out of the shadows. She
lashes back with lethal-intent knee and elbow-strikes ...
But deftly moving on pure instinct - Quaid blocks every
one and lays a spinning back-kick into her abdomen that
sends her smashing into the wall.
Instantly, HE has her GUN jammed into her cheek.
QUAID
Tell me everything. Now.
She looks at him, eyes enraged. He cocks the gun.
QUAID
Or we can skip straight to ‘until death
do us part.’
She grits her teeth, has no choice but to admit:
LORI
I’m not your wife.
QUAID
What the hell are you talking about?
She struggles against him, he grips her tighter.
QUAID
Tell me!
LORI
I’m Euromerican Federal Police Intel.
Assigned to play your wife. Six weeks
ago, I didn’t even know you.
38.
LORI (CONT'D)
QUAID
That’s impossible -
LORI
It’s the truth. Your memory was wiped
clean, your mind implanted with the life
you think you’ve lived. Get the picture
now? There is no “Douglas Quaid.” There
never was.
(sneers)
Surprise, asshole.
Quaid is reeling. It’s almost too much to take.
LORI
Deep down, did you really think someone
like me could marry someone like you?
He reddens. Shoves the gun back into her jaw.
QUAID
If I’m not me... then what’s my real
name? Huh? Who am I??
She gives him a near-contemptuous look.
LORI
How would I know? I’m like you - strictly
need-to-know. All I can say is, with all
the trouble Cohaagen’s taking to hide you
from the Resistance - you must be pretty
important.
QUAID
Cohaagen? But... if he hid me - why are
you trying to kill me?
LORI
Because those were my orders if you ever
snapped. Had to guess? You’re valuable
to Cohaagen, so you’re valuable to his
enemies too. And now that your mind’s
blown - whatever’s so valuable about you
is no longer containable by other means.
(shrugs)
Oh, and by the way?
She smacks the gun away, kicking him in the sternum.
LORI
You haven’t even begun to see me try to
kill you!
39.
Snatching a hideaway gun from beneath the kitchen table,
she turns and FIRES...
As Quaid goes crashing through the window.
EXT. SIDEWALK - QUAID’S APARTMENT - DAY
Rolling amidst a shower of glass, he hits his feet.
Quaid spins. Down the sidewalk - a BATTLE-ARMORED SENTRY
FOOT DETAIL is patrolling.
LORI skids out the doorway behind, BADGE in hand.
LORI
Federal Police Agent! Get him!
Quaid runs.
Lori doesn’t hesitate - she takes off after him.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Darting between mid-speed vehicles, Quaid hazards a look
back. LORI pulling parallel to his position fast.
She leaps, landing on the hood of a passing car.
Quaid doesn’t wait to see anymore - diverging onto the
sidewalk and pinballing through the packed pedestrians as
he RUNS full out.
Lori close behind - GUN out - slamming through people.
LORI
Federal Police! Out of the goddam way!
Ahead, Quaid ducks round a corner and into a side-street
where he slides to a halt - LORI skidding up behind him.
LORI
Don’t move!
GUN to his head. And then she sees what stopped him. The
CAR speeding down the street at them ...
Leaving her time only to DROP - and roll under - as Quaid
goes running up and OVER the car.
Beneath the vehicle, Lori’s GUN gets sucked slamming up
into the magnetic undercarriage... Such that when she
40.
rolls seamlessly back to her feet as the car passes over -
she is unarmed.
And Quaid is right there, to her frank surprise.
LORI
You’re good.
QUAID
Apparently.
And his FIST - already on its way - creates BLACKNESS.
EXT. SIDEWALKS - DAY
Quaid moving fast now - wary of every passerby. And then
something slows him. A strange sensation in his hand?
He looks to his hand to find that it’s actually VIBRATING -
and, turning over his palm, discovers what looks like a
KEY PAD glowing underneath his skin. A CELL PHONE
IMPLANT. What the fuck??
Cautiously, Quaid presses the small “ANSWER” ICON in his
palm, and tentatively lifts his hands to his ear ...
MALE VOICE
It’s Hammond.
Quaid narrows.
QUAID
I don’t know any Hammond.
MALE VOICE
Never mind that. Where are you,
Alexander?
QUAID
Alexander? Who’s -- wait, is that my
name? “Alexander?”
A sigh from the other end.
MALE VOICE
Oh shit, you said this might happen.
QUAID
I said what might happen? How do I know
you?
MALE VOICE
I worked with you. In the weapons lab.
41.
QUAID
Weapons lab?!
MALE VOICE
Jesus, you really don’t remember any of
it, do you.
(exhales)
Look - I saw the news, put two and two
together. You told me if things went
sideways I should call this number and
give you a message: Get the key.
QUAID
(overwhelmed)
What the hell is going on?! Who is it
you think I am?
MALE VOICE
Sorry, man - we were close, but this is
getting too crazy. I can’t get involved.
There is a click and the line goes dead. Quaid at a loss
for what the hell to do with what little he knows -
- when his embedded hand-phone beeps. Surprised, Quaid
looks at the screen through a fine layer of palm skin.
A TEXT MESSAGE: First Bank of New Asia. Box 10549.
INT. AN EXPENSIVE OFFICE INTERIOR - MORNING
Panoramic views of Euromerica below as we arrive behind a
MAN seated before a vid-screen on which we find Lori:
LORI (ON SCREEN)
(ego-bruised)
No, sir. He managed to get away.
MAN’S VOICE
Damn it, how could you let this happen?
Come around this man to discover it’s none other than
CHANCELLOR VILOS COHAAGEN himself. In person he comes
across as harder, colder, and presently very tense.
COHAAGEN
Stay after him. Marshal whatever
resources necessary.
LORI
Yes sir, but if I had a clearer picture
of the situation, I think I could-
42.
COHAAGEN
I’m not paying you to think. Just find
him.
EXT. FIRST BANK OF NEW ASIA - DAY
Quaid stops outside the towering building, facade dripping
with moisture and the chemical sludge deposited from the
assault of the New Asia atmosphere.
INT. FIRST BANK OF NEW ASIA - DAY
Quaid stops at a Clerk’s window. Clears his throat.
CLERK
May I help you, sir?
QUAID
I, uh, have a box here... Box 10549?
The Clerk turns the RETINAL-SCAN IDENTIFIER towards him.
Quaid hesitates - knows he has no choice but to lean in to
the scanner.
It scans, flashes green. On the Clerk’s screen, a long
list of account info pops up. The Clerk reviews it
briefly, then smiles up at Quaid.
CLERK
This way please.
Quaid concealing his relief as he follows The Clerk toward
the vault area, amazed he’s actually achieving this access
when -
CLERK
I just need a signature match.
The Clerk hands him a e-pad and stylus pen.
QUAID
(stalling)
Signature match...
CLERK
For the account?
(off Quaid’s hesitation)
Is there a problem, Mr. Reed?
Quaid quickly processes this - then shakes his head, takes
the pad and stylus, and with no choice but to give it a
shot, he signs: “Alexander Reed.”
43.
A beat; then the pad confirms: SIGNATURE MATCH BOX 10549.
Quaid practically exhales his relief.
INT. VAULT - DAY
The Clerk shows him into the vault.
CLERK
You can use any of these client rooms.
The Clerk proceeds to a desk terminal inside the vault to
wait for Quaid.
ON QUAID
As his eyes roam a series of security boxes. He finds Box
10549. Sees its secured by a thumb-print scanner.
Quaid inserts his thumb... and A STEEL DRAWER pops open.
IN ONE OF THE CLIENT ROOMS
Quaid slides a door shut, then proceeds to open the lid of
the safety deposit box drawer.
The first thing he finds inside the box is a curious METAL
OBJECT. Looks like a COLLAR of some kind? He sets it
aside, returns to the box. He finds other items. A wad
of money, and a COLLECTION OF RESIDENT I.D. CARDS and WORK
VISAS for various names and faces.
Quaid flips through them: various IDs for an old Chinese
Man, a younger African man, a Nordic-looking man, and a
bespectacled Caucasian face he doesn’t recognize but who
is identified on the ID card as “REED, ALEXANDER.”
That’s Alexander Reed? What the hell?
He quickly pockets all the ID documents, rifles through
the steel drawer to see if there’s anything else inside.
The only other thing he finds, tucked in the back of the
drawer, is a SMALL, BLACK RECTANGULAR WOODEN BLOCK.
Quaid inspects it - looks utterly useless, like a child’s
building block. Quaid figures he may as well pocket it
too, then checks to see if there’s anything else in the
drawer. Nothing. Even turns it over and shakes it -
looking for “the key.” But it’s empty.
Quaid rubs his temples, trying to figure his next move -
44.
ANGLE ON THE CLERK AT THE VAULT DESK
Idly typing on a holographic computer monitor.
QUAID (O.S.)
Excuse me...
The Clerk glances up.
QUAID
Sorry, I’m trying to remember when I was
last here?
The Clerk dutifully presses a few keys on his computer.
CLERK
Our records indicate six weeks ago.
QUAID
Six weeks ago...?
CLERK
Yes, Mr. Reed. Not physically, of
course. But that was the date of your
last data transfer.
QUAID
I transferred data... to my deposit box.
Right - of course. Thank you.
Quaid quickly ducks back into his private room --
TIGHT ON BOX 10549
as we find Quaid anxiously searching the steel box for
where such data might actually be stored. He finds a
small panel, touches it -
- and instantly the “lid” of the box becomes a sort of
video screen. A prompt blinks: “1 file stored.”
Quaid reaches out, presses it -
Suddenly a burst of static on the screen is followed by
A VIDEO IMAGE: in what looks like an empty MEDICAL LAB, a
MAN, frantic, turns on a computer camera, begins recording
-
We HEAR the man urgently talking to someone on his palmcell
as he heads away from camera - running to the door,
locking it shut, pushing a heavy desk in front to blockade
it.
45.
MAN
(on palm-cell; whispering)
-- Damn it Hammond listen to me! Do you
understand everything I just said?...
Because that’d mean risking your life as
well. Just do it, okay?
He deactivates his phone as he rushes back toward the
camera lens. We can now make out his MEDICAL GOWN as he
tears off tape from pulled IV’s that dangle from his arm.
His bloody fingers are seen typing away; we can’t see his
face as he speaks to the camera:
MAN (O.S.)
My cover’s blown and it’s all gone to
hell. They’re coming for me any second,
so I need to make this quick... Okay,
you’re gonna find this hard to believe -
The Man finally takes a seat - and we see QUAID’S FACE
peering right back at us. Looking fresh out of surgery -
a quick beat as he stares into the lens --
Our Quaid reacts in astonishment. What the fuck?
QUAID ON SCREEN
...But this is not your face. I’ve been
captured, and resculpted into this --
this person you think you are now.
Our Quaid is glued to the video.
QUAID ON SCREEN
If you’re watching this, it means I
failed to escape, and they’ve succeeded
in giving me - you - a new name, a new
identity, and a new set of memories...
And you just got a call from Hammond
telling you to access this deposit box.
Now the next thing you need to do is go
to my apartment--
Just then a SMASH! is heard in the background of the video
as the barricaded door is KNOCKED IN hard. Quaid on
screen reacts - fuck! He turns, desperate.
QUAID ON SCREEN
I’m not gonna make it.
(fast; conflicted)
I want to tell you more, but I can’t
trust you yet - there’s a chance they
could’ve gotten to Hammond. My only hope
46.
is - if you are me - you’ve found the key
and you’ll know what to do with it.
QUAID
(astonished)
What key?!
Quaid on screen becomes calm, giving into his fate as
behind him the SHADOWED INTRUDERS make it inside the room,
rushing up to GRAB HIM as he holds his stare directly into
the lens --
QUAID ON SCREEN
Good luck.
-- and CLICK, he sends the data file, and the image shorts
out to black.
QUAID
Wait -
Quaid frozen, staring uncertainly at the prompt blinking
“1 file stored.” On instinct he decides to delete it.
He then slowly stands, staring down at the now empty
security box drawer. Alone. Reeling...
ANGLE ON THE CLERK
As Quaid returns to the desk.
CLERK
All done, Mr. Reed?
QUAID
Yes, thanks. Before I go, could you just
check to see if you’ve got my most recent
address on file?
The Clerk clicks a few keys. Because of the holographic
screen, Quaid is actually able to see the on-screen
information floating (only it reads backwards). See
Quaid’s eyes quickly roaming over the information:
REED, ALEXANDER 218-87C HYPERION BLVD, DISTRICT E-14,
LEVEL 29, EUROMERICA
CLERK
(reading aloud)
We have your current address listed as
218-87C Hyperion Road, District...
The Clerk pauses, seeing something behind Quaid -- off his
nervous look, Quaid quickly turns to see
47.
QUAID ON SCREEN (CONT'D)
TWO SECURITY GUARDS
Blocking his path to the vault exit.
SECURITY GUARD 1
(to Quaid, firm)
Sir, we’re going to need you to please
stay where you are.
Quaid doesn’t move.
QUAID
Is there a problem?
SECURITY GUARD 2
There doesn’t have to be.
Threat planted, Guard 1 turns to the nervous Clerk.
SECURITY GUARD 1
We got a hit on a retinal scan for an
Alexander Reed. This him?
The Clerk just nods a feeble yes.
SECURITY GUARD 1 (CONT’D)
Mr. Reed, you’re going to have to come
with us.
QUAID
(backing up)
Why?
SECURITY GUARD 1
Sir, I’d advise you to do as you’re told.
The Guard moves in to grab Quaid and -- in a flash that
barely registers -- Quaid grabs his arm, pulling him into
a hard knee to the face, out cold as
Guard 2 has no chance to react to a lightening quick sweep
that takes him down to the floor, scrambling for his
fallen gun -- when Quaid pulls the Guard’s leg, sliding
him into a precision-placed elbow to the face. Lights out
times two.
Without missing a beat, Quaid quickly reaches up to press
the hidden button under the Clerk’s desk - activating the
DROP DOWN SECURITY GATE to the vault door and
ROLLS UNDER IT a split-second before it SLAMS shut -
locking the downed guards and the terrified Clerk inside!
48.
Quaid leaps to his feet, gathering his stuff as the
stunned Clerk gapes at him through the locked vault gate.
CLERK
H-How’d you do that?
Quaid takes a breath - almost equally amazed himself. We
detect a palpable thrill behind Quaid’s eyes.
QUAID
Your guess is as good as mine.
Off the Clerk’s look, Quaid hurries away.
EXT. CHINA FALL LOADING PLATFORM - EUROMERICA - MORNING
With a massive GROAN of mechanics, the gargantuan steel
leaves that seal the China Fall Shaft GRIND open...
And with a gigantic WHOOSH the CHINA FALL - arriving from
New Asia - climbs up out of the earth.
INT. CHINA FALL - EXITS - DAY
The MORNING MASS of workers from New Asia wait in orderly
lines to clear immigration and get to work.
ARMED SYNTHETIC SENTRIES are everywhere - identical to the
robots Quaid was quality controlling on the line.
An ELDERLY CHINESE MAN steps forward, presenting his WORK
VISA DOCUMENTS to the HUMAN SENTRY there.
The Sentry inspects the document, then directs the Chinese
Man to a security SCANNER. The Chinese Man looks confused
-
SECURITY SENTRY
We’re taking extra precautions this
morning. Step to the scanner.
The Elderly Chinese Man shuffles to the scanner, and as it
waves over him - his HAND flickers... from an Elderly
Asian Man’s to that of a YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE.
The Elderly Chinese Man pulls the hand back, shoves it in
his pocket. But the Human Sentry’s eyes are now up. The
Elderly Chinese Man grins - looking very worried.
Suddenly, his entire body beneath his head bursts sharply
with static and begins flickering, flashing through bodytypes
of every possible shape, size, color and ethnicity.
49.
We recognize faces from the IDs Quaid secured from Box
10549 - including that of Alexander Reed...
 HUMAN SENTRY
(bursting to his feet)
Anti-Cognition Collar!
As his rifle swings up, for an instant, the Chinese man’s
body stops flickering and abruptly disappears altogether.
Only to reappear an instant later with QUAID’S BODY
beneath the head and alarmed face of a old Chinese man.
As 2 SYNTHETIC SENTRIES skid up, the Chinese Man’s head
begins to flash with multi-colored static and suddenly
QUAID - full and complete - is standing there - staring
back at them.
HUMAN SENTRY
Take him!
Quaid doesn’t wait. Ripping off the ANTI-COGNITION COLLAR,
he hurls it in the face of the nearest Synth Sentry. And
as the others OPEN FIRE - he moves ...
Dispatching the nearest Synth as bullets whistle around
him - he spins into the cover of a shredding pillar - the
dead sentry’s automatic rifle now in his grasp as he...
Returns FIRE, opening his escape - and RUNS...
INT. CHINA FALL STATION - DAY
LORI comes skidding up.
LORI
What happened!?
The SYNTH CAPTAIN there turns from his microcommunicator.
SYNTH CAPTAIN
Quaid.
Her eyes say it all.
INT. CONNECTING GLIDE-TRAIN STATION - DAY
Quaid comes tearing down the steps, spilling people before
him - surging for the GLIDE-TRAIN...
Too late. The top-loading train already gaining speed,
pulling out from below the pedestrian platform.
50.
Quaid spins - Synth Team right on his heels, alerting
citizens to get down as they take aim - giving Quaid no
other option but to ...
LEAP - over the platform ledge, and onto the top of the
speeding train, which travels five times faster than the
hover traffic flowing directly beneath it.
THE SYNTH TEAM
Radios to alert the security on board the train as...
EXT. TRAIN TOP - DAY
Quaid sees - coming in the far distance ... AN OVERPASS
with futuristic clearance tolerances of an inch. Instantly
he spins, racing to the nearest top-loading door ...
sealed tight ...
And the overpass - coming - fast. Really fast. Using his
machine gun like a crowbar, he forces the slide door open,
TUMBLING inside - overpass demolishing the discarded
machine gun in its wake. Close call.
INT. TRAIN - DAY
Quaid comes tumbling in - finding his feet amidst the
startled crowd ... INSTANTLY AWARE of the SYNTH, barreling
through the train car at him ... He runs.
INT. ADJACENT TRAIN CAR - DAY
Bursting into the opposite car - only to find - through
the startled, screaming crowd of packed passengers ...
ANOTHER Synth bulling towards him.
Leaving him nowhere to go but DOWN. Passengers back away
as he pries the seal from the floor’s emergency hatch,
warning lights blare as the hatch hisses open to reveal
A SPEEDING FREEWAY of hover vehicles directly below. Quaid
draws in a breath, and lowers himself through...
EXT. TRAIN BOTTOM - DAY
Quaid dangles. Slicing the air as he skims just above the
speeding cars roofs. He looks up. The Synths charging ...
In two seconds - he’s dead, and in one - he JUMPS.
51.
Crashing down onto the hood of a car passing beneath,
causing the terrified driver to swerve - slamming the car
speeding beside ... the force of the impact sending Quaid
tumbling from one hood to the other.
He manages to catch hold - when a HONKING turns his head -
Surprised to see ...
An unmarked vehicle pulling up parallel to the one he is
on. And is even more surprised when - the passenger door
slides open to reveal the driver is MELINA.
MELINA
Come on!
Quaid blinks. Astonished. But her eyes are in the mirror.
MELINA
Now!
He looks. Sees what she sees. A bristling TIDAL WAVE of
red police lights coming at them... shit.
He rolls - falling into the passenger seat of her car -
extending out over the speeding roadway like a drawer.
QUAID
It’s you. I don’t -- how did you -?
Before she can reply - and before Quaid’s seat has
retracted back into the car - the police are upon them,
SLAMMING Melina’s drivers side, window shattering as...
Her car is sent SMASHING into the divide, closing Quaid’s
door for him now - hard. Jamming Quaid inside as Melina
struggles to SCRAPE her hover vehicle free, swinging the
car back into traffic - weaving - police chasing ...
Quaid stares at her - stunned.
MELINA
I’ve been following you.
A RISE OF POLICE VEHICLES coming at them in the other
direction causes her...
MELINA
Damn it...
To abruptly swing the car out, clipping others, and into a
side street, slamming back into gear stepping on it ...
52.
QUAID
Following me... Wait! You mean - back on
the platform -
MELINA
(nods; quickly)
We’d been searching for you ever since
you disappeared from the weapons lab. We
scanned thousands of profiles, trying to
figure out how they’d hidden youQUAID
“We” - who’s “we?”
Quaid stares at her - pieces slamming.
QUAID
You’re with the Resistance, aren’t you?
Melina glances at him by way of affirmation.
INT. POLICE VEHICLE - DAY
In a Police Vehicle pulling in hard behind them: LORI.
LORI
Ram it.
The Police Driver looks at her. Impatient, she takes the
steering wheel, pulling it sliding across the dash to her
side.
INT. MELINA’S VEHICLE - DAY
As they emerge from beneath the train-way and under the
open sky of the city.
QUAID
(accusing)
Why were you following me?
MELINA
Listen, it’s complicated. I can try to
explain it on the way.
QUAID
(dubious)
On the way where?
She looks over at him.
53.
MELINA
My orders are to take you to Quatto.
QUAID
I don’t care what your “orders” are! No
way am I going to--
SMASH! The car jumps as it’s rammed from behind - pieces
flying as Melina fights to keep control. Correcting, she
hits the steering lock and sends the steering wheel
sliding cross the dash in front of Quaid. He looks at her,
astonished. She holds his gaze - hard.
MELINA
You have to trust me.
(off Quaid’s reluctance)
Please.
He stares at her a wary beat - and as LORI slams the
pursuing police vehicle into them again from behind -
Quaid GRABS the wheel - PULLS - and dangerously hoverslides
across four lanes of traffic and enters an off ramp
...
only the ‘off ramps’ in this world are more like car
elevators that magnetically lift or, in Quaid’s case ...
Lower the vehicle down to the next city level - merging
into another expressway below ... however this traffic
flows underneath the structure - magnetic system holding
the vehicles suspended as they travel.
Lori’s car holding tight - smashing through intervening
traffic like a tank, descending the traffic elevator -
staying with them as she slides the wheel back to the
driver. She draws her sidearm, leans out and OPENS FIRE.
Grabbing Melina, Quaid pushes her ...
QUAID
Down!
Swerving, BULLETS blasting sheet metal - And up ahead ...
MELINA
Look out!
The horizon becomes a bristling of furious red flashing
lights. A POLICE BLOCKADE. Hanging. Gliding. Coming fast.
Quaid scans quickly - sees a veritable wall of law
enforcement. Behind - Lori hanging out the passenger
54.
window of the vehicle racing up behind them, focusing her
hand-cannon.
QUAID
You have your seatbelt on?
She doesn’t. He reaches for the ignition.
MELINA
What’re you doing!?
QUAID
You might want to put that seatbelt on.
Melina nervously straps in and... He kills it. All of it.
All 8 cylinders. The magnetic induction holding them to
the roadway above ... It all suddenly dies and -
The vehicle plummets straight out of traffic. Dropping
like a stone... as Lori’s vehicle slams through the space
they just occupied, rear-ending the car ahead...
QUAID fights to re-engage the magnetic induction ... Car
in a mid-air dead drop as it - HUMS back to life - just as
it comes soaring down towards ...
EXT. 21ST CENTURY ERA STREETS - DAY
WHEELED TRAFFIC swerving. TIRES screeching as Quaid’s car
makes contact - it’s hover propulsion interacting with the
metal rooftops of other cars like reverse magnets -
sending those cars, and Quaid’s, skipping across asphalt.
Quaid and Melina hold tight - their hover car useless on
normal streets - Scraping. Spinning. Until ...
It all comes to an abrupt stop into a skidding DOUBLE
DECKER RED BUS - air-brakes meet shattering glass.
INT. MELINA’S CAR - DAY
Smoke filled and shattered. Melina peels her eyes open.
Dazed. Slumps back in her seat to find ...
Quaid is not in his. She scans - pedestrians starting to
gather ... Then, outside the shattered windshield she
finds him. Standing in the street in the rising smoke.
Melina looks at him - question large in her eyes. For a
moment their eyes lock... we see something stirred in
Quaid... he looks truly torn...
55.
QUAID
I want to trust you... I just can’t.
And, without a another word, he vanishes into the haze of
smoke and gathering crowds.
EXT. EUROMERICAN APARTMENT CITY - DAY
Quaid stops in the geometric infinity that is APARTMENT
CITY in Euromerica. A horizonless expanse of tiny but
perfectly ordered and identical dwellings all honeycombed
together in an endless bee-hive.
Checks both ways. Heads for the nearest building.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
He stops at a door - notes the door knob fitted with
fingertip scans where one would grip it. Quaid gives it a
shot... and the door clicks unlocked as we hear:
FEMALE COMPU-VOICE
(saccharine-sweet)
Welcome home, Mr. Reed. Did you have a
nice day?
QUAID
(deadpan)
It’s been awesome, thanks.
Quaid opens the door and enters
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Silence. Everything ordered in claustrophobic perfection.
Drapes scatter a fine light through the dust hanging in
the air. Been a while since anyone’s been in here.
ON QUAID standing in the center of the room. Taking in
every detail. Moving to a PIANO, he finds something
resting on the top: a yellow SECURITY BADGE for a FEDERAL
LABORATORY made out to Alexander Reed. That same
Caucasian face we’d seen generated by the anti-cognition
collar smiles blandly back at us from the badge photo.
Quaid stares at the photo in frustration.
QUAID
Why the hell did you send me here...?
Quaid looks around the place, desperate for a clue --
56.
INT. HOME OFFICE - DAY
Quaid tears the filing cabinets open, one after another.
EMPTY.
Moving to the desk, he tries the drawers. EMPTY.
INT. DEN - DAY
Quaid tears back the carpet. The WALL PAPER on the wall
all around has already all been painstakingly torn away.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
QUAID drops, defeated, onto the piano stool.
Absently plunks an OLD MELODY on the keyboard as his eyes
rove the room around him, wishing something - anything -
would present itself...
When one of the piano keys he presses fails to produce a
note. Quaid depresses it again - the key is clearly
dead...
TIGHT ON QUAID as something suddenly occurs to him - eyes
wide, he anxiously rifles through his pockets, quickly
pulls out
THAT SMALL, BLACK RECTANGULAR BLOCK he’d found in the
safety deposit box. Holds it up to discover it’s the
exact shape and size of a black piano key.
Quaid returns to the dead key, tugs at it - and finds that
it easily comes free of the keyboard. Quaid sets it
aside, then replaces the key with the black key he’d
obtained from the deposit box...
Abruptly, there is a click, followed by a whir...
And a HOLOGRAM appears, projecting from the piano-top,
constructing itself in three transparent layers...
Into the TOPOGRAPHIC IMAGE... of ALEXANDER REED.
ALEXANDER REED’S HOLOGRAM
This message has limited interactive
capabilities. It’s being recorded as a
fail-safe, in the event of a worst-case
scenario.
(a tense smile)
So that’s the bad news. The good news,
if you can call it that, is that I knew
57.
from the start if Cohaagen ever caught on
to what I was doing, he’d wipe my mind.
(beat)
I can only guess what you’ve been
through, and how desperate you must be
for some answers. So I’ll start at the
top...
Reed reaches his hands up to his own neck, adjusts
something - and with a flicker we see him remove his anticognition
collar to reveal his true face...
REVERSE ON QUAID as he sees it before we do -
QUAID
(recognizing it)
No... No, you’re -- you’re Hauser...
REVERSE ON THE HOLOGRAM to reveal the face we’d seen on
the news: CARL HAUSER.
HAUSER’S HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE
That’s right. Carl Hauser. Former
Intelligence Operative turned
revolutionary. Cohaagen sent me to
infiltrate the Resistance, and instead I
realized they were the ones I should be
fighting for.
QUAID
It can’t be...
The image glitches, jumping back to its pre-set response:
HAUSER’S HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE
This message has limited interactive
capabilities. Please rephrase.
QUAID
I can’t be you...
The image glitches back again. Hauser smiles.
HOLOGRAM/HAUSER
Sorry to disappoint.
Quaid rises from the bench, shaking his head.
QUAID
I don’t believe you... You’re a traitor -
a terrorist -
58.
ALEXANDER REED’S HOLOGRAM 
HOLOGRAM/HAUSER
I’d take offense to that if I were you.
And I am.
ON QUAID: a part of him already sensing it’s true.
QUAID
No. I don’t want this...
HOLOGRAM/HAUSER
Too bad. Because if you quit on me now,
a lot of people are going to die.
(beat)
Now you need to listen, because you’ve
probably been fed a lot of lies about who
I am. Here’s the truth... Cohaagen and I
go way back - during the war, he was my
commanding officer. So when he ordered
me to infiltrate the Resistance and
assassinate Quatto, I never questioned
him. I did as I was told, and tricked
the Resistance into believing I was one
of them. Only in playing my role, I
learned a few things. Like what love
was. And who the good guys were. I
switched sides, and confessed everything.
Hauser’s 3-D image nods.
HOLOGRAM/HAUSER
We’d been hearing rumors of a weapon that
Cohaagen was developing. I volunteered
to use my skills as a spy to go back
under and find out exactly what this
weapon was.
The hologram shakes its head.
HOLOGRAM/HAUSER
But if I’m sitting here now, it means the
weapon is complete - and something went
wrong when Quatto’s people tried to
retrieve me.
Quaid stares at the hologram - mind spinning.
HAUSER’S HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE
So now I need you - the world needs you -
to reconnect with the Resistance.
Because whatever it is I discovered?
It’s still in my head.
(taps his temple)
And only Quatto can retrieve it.
59.
Quaid opens his mouth but abruptly, the Hologram ...
HOLOGRAM/HAUSER
Hope you make the right decision.
Because the fate of the world hangs on
what you - on what we - do next.
Hauser flickers, then glitches out -- leaving Quaid
staring at the empty space a beat, completely and utterly
floored.
QUAID
You’ve gotta be kidding me.
EXT. HAUSER’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Walking - stunned - Quaid drifts to a stop. Ahead, a
SYNTHETIC SENTRY PATROL is making its rounds.
Quaid hesitates. Torn. Starts to head towards a TRAIN
STATION across the street ...
And that’s when he feels someone behind him. Startled, he
quickly turns to find
MELINA. She looks him steadily in the eyes.
MELINA
I had a feeling you’d come here.
Quaid gives her a hard look - then keeps walking past her,
toward the Station. She keeps up.
MELINA
That morning, on the platform, when I saw
how you looked at me - for a moment I
thought maybe you recognized me. I was
going to retrieve you, but there were all
these police and -
QUAID
(brusk)
I’d never seen you before in my life.
She reaches for his arm.
MELINA
Hauser -
QUAID
(flashes)
My name is Doug Quaid! That’s who I am.
Like it or not, it’s all I know!
60.
His eyes burn into hers. The only sound that of an
arriving train. Quaid starts around her again - but she
steps in front of him.
MELINA
Quaid then - listen to me. Do you think
I’m doing all this just for the
Resistance?
She shakes her head - making certain her eyes are in his.
MELINA
No. I loved a man too.
Quaid can’t help but pause on this... but wills himself to
push past her -
MELINA
That scar on your hand.
Quaid halts. Glances back, confused.
MELINA
How do you think you got it?
QUAID
(hesitates; uneasy)
At work -
Melina shakes her head - then slowly raises her own hand
and turns it upward...
To reveal an identical CIRCULAR SCAR in her own palm.
MELINA
We were under attack. Cohaagen’s forces.
I fell. As you caught my hand, a piece
of shrapnel tore through yours...
(a swallow/a nod)
Through our ... hands.
Quaid is completely thrown as she reaches out and clasps
her hand tightly into his, forcing the SCARRED ENTRY WOUND
on the back of his hand to show skyward, then turns their
hands - to show the MATCHING EXIT WOUND on the back of
hers. Lining up perfectly.
Their eyes meet. She’s searching his for any sign of
recognition.
QUAID
(struggling)
I don’t remember. I’m sorry...
61.
MELINA
I understand. I just - I’d hoped
something might survive.
She lets his hand go. A rueful half-smile masking the
pain in her face -
 - when over her shoulder, Quaid spots a SECOND SYNTH
PATROL coming their way. Off his look, she turns, sees it
too.
MELINA
We need to go. Now.
Quaid hesitates -
QUAID
To Quatto?
(shakes his head)
You don’t get it. Even if I was Hauser -
it’s not who I am now.
Over his shoulder, the SYNTH PATROL is almost upon them.
Urgently, she shakes her head. Voice a racing whisper.
MELINA
A man is the sum of his actions, not his
names. Don’t you owe it to yourself - to
the world ...
Her hand tightens on his.
MELINA
And just maybe even me - to find out who
the sum of you really is?
Quaid stares back - mind racing. Over her shoulder, he
sees the first Synth Patrol just steps away.
SYNTH PATROL
Hey! You!
Abruptly pulling Melina by their clasped hands - Quaid
ducks them sideways thru the closing doors of the TRAIN.
INT. TRAIN - DAY
As the doors slap shut and the train begins to accelerate -
he guides her back through the crowds...
62.
INT. FINAL TRAIN CAR - DAY
To the final empty car, where he shorts-out the door so
that it remains locked shut, sealing them into their own
vacuum of space.
He turns to her, their faces inches apart.
QUAID
Let’s say I did decide to trust you. Why
is it so important that I get to Quatto?
Hauser’s message talked about something
being inside my head...
MELINA
Before you went undercover to spy on
Cohaagen’s weapons program, Quatto
ordered a “Black Box” to be implanted in
your brain.
(off his frown)
It’s like a neural hard-drive that
records everything you see. So that even
if you were completely annihilated,
whatever information you discovered would
still be retrievable.
QUAID
(flatly)
You’re saying there’s a little safe... in
my skull.
MELINA
And only Quatto has the cryptonym to
unlock it.
QUAID
I thought no one’s ever allowed anywhere
near Quatto?
MELINA
Only his most trusted people. It’s the
only way to ensure his safety.
QUAID
But he’s going to make an exception in my
case.
(off her nod)
Lucky me.
Quaid chews on it...
QUAID
And once Quatto’s got the plans for this
weapon, what’s he going to do? Destroy
63.
it?
(darkly)
Or use it to kill even more civilians.
MELINA
Doug - wake up. That’s nothing but
propaganda. These recent attacks weren’t
the work of the Resistance. Our targets
have always been restricted to military
installations and cyberspace.
QUAID
(dubious)
So, what - Cohaagen’s been bombing his
own people?
MELINA
(nods)
The federal labs, those mag-train
bombings - it’s all been orchestrated by
Cohaagen. He’s the one behind all these
new attacks.
Quaid pales at the thought.
QUAID
But - why?
MELINA
That’s what we need to find out. And if
Quatto’s suspicions are correct... the
answer is inside your head.
ON QUAID: processing everything she’s told him.
Then turns to her:
QUAID
What was I -- I mean Hauser - like?
She considers the question. Softer:
MELINA
You were brave. Brilliant. Impatient.
Funny.
(a sad smile; missing him)
Full of yourself sometimes.
Quaid listening intensely. Melina’s smile fades.
MELINA
And you had regrets.
64.
QUAID (CONT'D)
QUAID
About working for Cohaagen, you mean.
MELINA
(nods)
You were promised power, wealth... your
place in history. But when you saw how
things really were in New Asia - the
desperate conditions, the starving and
the sick - you realized how much Cohaagen
could have done for us, and how little he
had. And you became painfully aware of
your own role in all of it.
Quaid absorbs it all. Then, carefully:
QUAID
And you and I - we were...?
Melina nods, pushing back the pain as she raises her eyes
to Quaid’s. Each searching the other’s, a fraught beat --
-- when they feel the TRAIN GLIDING TO A HALT? Melina and
Quaid quickly peer out the window - they’re between
stations. And that’s when they hear commotion in
THE NEXT CAR
As Synth Sentries push through, searching the confused
passengers -- clearly they were notified that Quaid and
Melina are on board.
The Sentries finally arrive at the door to the last car.
Try it - find it’s been shorted out. Instantly alert -
SENTRY 1
Quick!
They proceed to pry the shorted door open, guns drawn as
they burst into
THE FINAL CAR
to find it empty. A single window has been smashed. And
beyond it -
- the fleeing figures of Quaid and Melina on the ground
below, racing away on foot.
EXT. STREET - EUROMERICA - DAY
Quaid and Melina hurrying through crowds. In their
peripheral vision they can make out a Synth Patrol
65.
clocking them. The Synth starts to follow them...
In seconds two more Synths have joined the first... and
then we hear sirens preceding the arrival of Federal
Police vehicles, descending on the street.
Quaid looks to Melina - they know they’re being cornered.
Behind them they can hear their pursuers coming closer...
QUAID
This way!
He grabs Melina and tugs her into the service entrance of
INT. A HUGE BUILDING - SERVICE ENTRY CORRIDORS - DAY
Quaid and Melina race through a narrow passageway, turn a
corner to another. Running for their lives, they spot a
sign directing them to a “Lobby.” They bolt in that
direction, bang through another door and into
AN ENORMOUS LOBBY
Pedestrians milling, opulent decor -- and then Quaid
freezes, grabbing Melina to halt her as she too sees
THROUGH THE WINDOWS
A FLEET OF FEDERAL POLICE AND SYNTH PATROL vehicles have
amassed out front. Human and Synth officers fanned out,
weapons at the ready.
Quaid and Melina look to each other. They’re surrounded.
Quaid grabs Melina and hurries behind a partition wall.
Gasping and scared, their eyes meet.
And for a moment we see something in Quaid. He cares
about her.
QUAID
We’re gonna find a way out of here.
His eyes dart, looking for any sort of option when -
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Doug?
The voice sounds hollow in the grand space - but also
familiar...? Quaid suddenly lifts his head as he
recognizes it as -
HARRY??
66.
Sure enough, Harry is here, having just entered the lobby
through the front doors. He’s wearing a bullet-proof vest
and pacing cautiously, his hands raised shoulder-high in
an “I come in peace” gesture.
HARRY
Doug...
Quaid finally steps out with his gun raised more as a
precaution than a threat.
QUAID
(stunned)
Harry? What are you doing here?
Harry continues toward Quaid, his voice steady, assuring:
HARRY
They sent me in for you. To talk you
down.
QUAID
(narrowing)
Who sent you? Cohaagen?
Harry shakes his head, pitying.
HARRY
Doug, you don’t get it. I don’t mean
they sent me in here... I mean they sent
me into your mind.
Quaid looks at him. Harry moves closer.
HARRY
I need you to listen to me. You’re
suffering what’s called a paranoid
dissociative break, brought on by the
trauma of a chemical fantasy. You’ve had
an adverse reaction to mind-tripping.
Quaid reels slightly. His gun tightens in his grasp.
QUAID
... what the hell are you talking
about...?
HARRY
You’re not actually here, Doug.
Quaid looks around. Back.
67.
HARRY
You’re still back in that tripping den -
strapped to a chair, needle hanging out
of your arm; eyes rolled back into your
head... I know it’s almost impossible
for you to accept, but it’s true.
None of this is real.
A GUN abruptly appears behind Harry’s head - wielded by
Melina, getting the jump on him.
MELINA
He’s lying. Trying to manipulate you.
Harry calmly ignores her - remains looking at Quaid.
HARRY
When we were back at the bar, you had me
worried. So I followed you. But by the
time I got here, it was too late. You
were unresponsive.
Melina looks anxiously at Quaid, sees he’s struggling with
this insane possibility...
HARRY
So I was chemically transfused into your
mind. They thought a familiar face might
help. To try to bring you back. Before
it’s too late.
MELINA
Quaid, don’t listen to him - it’s a trap.
They have us surrounded, so they’re
thinking they can take you alive and
recover what’s in your head.
HARRY
Doug, I assure you -
MELINA
Think - does he even sound like the Harry
you know? He was a plant, just like your
wife! To keep you in line.
HARRY
I don’t sound like me, Doug, because you
don’t want me to. You need to
understand, I’m merely the idea of Harry:
an antidotal serum injected into your
brain to provoke a corrective emotional
response. The rest is supplied by your
own imagination. Even the explanation
I’m giving you right now. It’s really
68.
you carrying on an internal dialogue
prompted by the serum. Your mind is
providing the words because that’s where
we are, Doug. In your mind.
QUAID
If none of this is real - how come you’re
wearing a bullet-proof vest?
HARRY
(doesn’t miss a beat)
Because you put it on me. Don’t you see?
Your mind is desperate to preserve this
paranoid fantasy you’ve constructed, but
a part of you wants to protect me. To
let me guide you back to consciousness,
before you slip into permanent psychosis.
To convince you...
(he nods)
... to save yourself.
Quaid hesitates minutely. The gun in his hand trembling.
HARRY
You need to accept that this is all just
a dark, warped projection of your own
desire for a life of purpose - it’s the
ultimate ego trip.
MELINA
Doug, you can’t buy into this. Look at
me: I’m real. And so is he. He’s been
working for Cohaagen, just likeQUAID
(staring off)
Lori?
FOLLOW QUAID’S STUNNED GAZE TO THE LOBBY WINDOW...
... where we now discover LORI OUTSIDE among the amassed
Federal Police and Synths, looking truly frightened,
vulnerable, in tears - pleading with them to let her
inside (ala ”That’s my husband in there!”)
HARRY (O.S.)
That’s right. She’s here too, Doug. Not
in your mind, but in the room. Beside
you. Holding your hand right now, worried
sick. It’s her presence you’re sensing.
ON QUAID: staring at Lori, overwhelmed with confusion -
what happened to Lori the ruthless killer?
69.
HARRY (CONT'D)
HARRY (O.S.)
As soon as I told her what was
happening, she came straight over.
QUAID
You called her at work?
HARRY (O.S.)
I had to. She loves you, Doug.
ON MELINA: gaping anxiously at Lori pleading like the
dutiful wife outside, fearing the impact on Quaid -
- when Harry seizes Melina’s distraction and grabs her gun
from her hand.
MELINA
Quaid!
Quaid spins, trains his gun back on Harry; Harry keeps
Melina’s gun trained on Melina.
QUAID
(harder)
Lori didn’t work last night, Harry.
You’re lying.
Is that a flicker of nervousness in Harry’s eyes before he
blinks? He keeps his gun on Melina...
HARRY
Only because you wanted me to. You’re
clinging to the delusion -
MELINA
Damn it, Doug, this isn’t a delusion!
HARRY
No? Okay, fine. I’ll tell you what...
Harry considers the stand-off a beat - and then hands
Melina’s gun back to her. Quaid is thrown.
HARRY
Is that proof enough for you? Would I
have done that if this was for real?
Melina keeps her gun trained on Harry, but she’s scared by
the unsure expression on Quaid’s face -
HARRY
You see? I’m not afraid, Doug. And you
shouldn’t be either -
70.
MELINA
I swear if you don’t shut up I’m going to
shoot youQUAID
Don’t.
Melina is stunned - struck by the pained look on Quaid’s
face. He’s truly torn, clearly on the fence...
MELINA
(pleads)
Doug - please - trust me. We have to get
out of here...
HARRY
And go where? There’s no getting out of
your own head, Doug. But you can escape
this nightmare. If you let me help you.
QUAID
Help me how?
HARRY
(calmly; looks to Melina)
You have to shoot her, Doug.
(off Quaid’s shock)
I know that’s asking everything of you,
but she’s at the epicenter of this whole
twisted fantasy. She represents all your
frustration, all your unhappiness.
That’s why it would mean nothing if I
were to kill her - it’s you who has to
choose reality. You shoot her, Doug, and
I promise, you will gasp awake and find
me sitting right beside you. The real me
- your old friend Harry. Turn, and
you’ll see your beautiful, loving wife,
who is terrified right now. She wants
you back, Doug. We both do.
(nods)
Come back.
Quaid hesitates, overwhelmed... Then lowers his gun to his
side.
HARRY
That’s right, Doug. Come on back.
Panicked, Melina instantly aims her own gun on Quaid.
QUAID
(thrown)
Melina...?
71.
MELINA
(pained)
I can’t let them take you. I’m sorry - I
still love you, no matter who you are -
but I can’t let what’s in your head fall
into Cohaagen’s hands.
Quaid’s eyes lock on Melina’s - a powerful moment between
them, rife with regrets. Melina’s finger quivers on the
trigger, trying to will herself to squeeze it...
But she can’t. She just can’t do it.
HARRY
Of course she can’t do it, Doug. She’s
not real. Now you just need to prove it
to yourself. End her, Doug. And end
this nightmare.
Trembling, Quaid’s gun rises - pointed at Melina.
HARRY
That’s it, Doug. Free yourself!
Quaid’s grip hardens on his gun. He levels it between
Melina’s eyes. Trembling.
But she only looks back at him - ready.
A SINGLE TEAR sliding down her cheek.
Quaid’s eyes clear on the tear ...
HARRY (O.S.)
Do it! Search yourself and you’ll know
what’s real and what isn’t.
And the SCAR on the back of his hand ...
HARRY
(more rabid)
Shoot her! Kill her damn it! Shoot!
SHOOT!
Something in Quaid shifting, his expression suddenly
decisive as he turns and
BOOM! puts a BULLET into Harry. For an instant time
almost stands still as Harry drops -
- and then the windows and walls INSTANTLY EXPLODE with
GUNFIRE!
Quaid grabs Melina ...
72.
QUAID
Come on!
They start to bolt, then abruptly duck back behind a
partition as a HAIL OF GUNFIRE erupts at them. Both
desperate for a way out.
An ELEVATOR waits tantalizingly across the lobby. Quaid
grabs Melina and they bolt inside it just as DOORS CLOSE.
INT. ELEVATOR CAR
Gliding upward. A brief respite, Quaid and Melina alone.
Gasping for breath.
Melina looks up into his eyes, starts to say something --
when Quaid suddenly KISSES her. She’s taken aback for an
instant - then gives herself over with a rush of emotion.
When they part, it’s clear neither knows what to make of
it. Their body language tentative. Raw. Melina reaches
out to run her fingers over Quaid’s face.
QUAID
(quietly)
That morning - on the platform... I know
I said I’d never seen you before, but - I
felt something.
MELINA
(confused)
You remembered me? But - you had your
mind erased -?
QUAID
I guess some things - they just stay with
you no matter what.
She allows a trace of hope in her smile, perhaps about to
kiss him again -
- when the elevator stops. DING! the doors glide open to
A CORRIDOR
Seemingly empty. Doors closing behind them, Quaid and
Melina step out, peer around - and suddenly BULLETS blast
by their heads. They duck around a corner. A beat -
FEMALE VOICE
Doug...
Quaid frowns, hazards an attempt at peering out, glimpses
73.
LORI, pistol double-fisted, with TWO SYNTHETIC SENTRIES.
What was a tearful, sympathetic Lori is now a hardened
killer once again.
Quaid ducks back. Shit.
LORI’S VOICE
(calling out)
Or should I call you Hauser? How’s it
feel to finally be important?
(a laugh)
Cohaagen filled me in. Guess the joke’s
on me. I really thought you were a
schlub. Turns out I was living with the
greatest intelligence agent alive.
ANGLE ON LORI from behind her corner:
LORI
You can still turn yourself in, you know.
(lips curl)
What’ll it be, Doug?
Quaid nods at Melina, and they make a run for it.
Lori raises her gun and opens fire on them. Bullets
sparking all around them as Melina drops to a knee and
lays cover fire as she shouts to Quaid:
MELINA
Get that elevator back open!
Quaid sprints for the elevator door as Lori and two Synth
Guards fire mercilessly. Melina still laying cover.
MELINA
Almost out!
Quaid tosses her his gun -- Melina catches it, reaches
around the corner and fires more shots at Lori...
... as Quaid finally manages to pry the elevator door open
a crack.
ANGLE ON LORI AND THE SYNTHS
Taking cover from Melina’s blind shots.
LORI
Move in!
BACK TO QUAID
As the elevator door finally opens - just as an ELEVATOR
74.
CAR whizzes past - only this time horizontally (and we
realize these elevators are multi-directional). Quaid
glances back to Melina as she joins him, ducking into
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT
Horizontal. Quaid and Melina race down the shaft - when
they see the hint of something rising ahead... ANOTHER
ELEVATOR (like a CUBE). It halts, then starts fast at
them. Melina turns to retreat - but Quaid grabs her.
QUAID
No - come on!
Trusting him, Melina and Quaid start running directly at
the elevator flying toward them... and DIVE into an
opening in the floor as the cube smashes past overhead.
BACK TO LORI AND THE SYNTHS IN PURSUIT. Arriving at the
shaft. In an instant bullets are ricocheting as Quaid and
Melina sprint away -- then stumble to halt as they reach
THE EDGE OF THE SHAFT, beyond which is a huge drop off
into an AWESOME CHASM OF MOVING ELEVATOR CUBES going up
and down, back and forth. One such elevator is emerging
directly below them - about 40 feet.
QUAID
There!
MELINA
It’s too far!
But as they peer back at Lori and Synths rapidly
approaching, they know they have no choice but to JUMP -
LANDING HARD atop the elevator, Melina rolling over the
edge -- Quaid CATCHES HER ARM just in time. He’s pulling
her up as they ascend back up toward
THE SHAFT THEY JUST JUMPED FROM. Inside Lori dispatches a
Synth, who lurches forward at a sprint to intercept the
elevator cube when it passes...
BACK TO QUAID AND MELINA ATOP THE CUBE
About to pass the open shaft -
QUAID
Give me your gun!
She tosses him her gun just as they arrive at the shaft
and Quaid blasts back the Synth as they ascend. The Synth
LUNGES and grabs on to their cube’s underside.
75.
ON QUAID AND MELINA’S RISING ELEVATOR CUBE
The Synth begins to scale its side, as on top Quaid and
Melina get to their feet... only to discover the Synth
climbing up toward them --
Abruptly the elevator jolts to a HALT. Then begins to
enter another shaft, leaving Quaid and Melina, perched
above, about to get scraped off! They’re either going to
be killed by the climbing Synth or die from the fall -
- when Melina spots a hatch by her feet. She kicks at it
frantically and it gives, allowing her to drop into
THE ELEVATOR’S INTERIOR
PASSENGERS inside understandably surprised.
Quaid starts to drop in behind her -- when the Synth grabs
his arm from above! Quaid flails, trying to pry free...
Melina grabs his torso, pulling him down just as the cube
enters the shaft and the Synth’s arm shears off!
Quaid and Melina catch their breath - only now aware of
the shocked faces of other passengers. Awkward beat...
DING! The elevator arrives at its stop. Doors glide open,
passengers exiting -- to reveal Lori and two more Synths!
They open fire on Quaid and Melina -
- both duck to the side, Quaid frantically pressing the
“Close” button, only to read: “Door Malfunction.” Lori
sees her chance, races at the open door... as the car
resumes its descent, Lori arriving too late, the elevator
descending when
BAM! The ceiling hatch pops open and Lori drops in the
same way Quaid and Melina entered!
Punches and kicks flying as Lori furiously tries to get a
shot off. Quaid manages to pry her gun away -
- just as a SYNTH drops in from the hatch too! The cube
still plummeting, Melina battles it out with Lori, while
Quaid manages to force the Synth into the open door, the
Synth scraping with wild sparks against the shaft wall...
Melina and Lori still battling it out; Quaid trying to
keep the pressure on the Synth as the robot’s torso shoots
sparks - when an opening in the shaft allows Quaid to
shove the Synth out - the Synth instantly obliterated.
Lori clocks the loss of the Synth... and that the elevator
has stopped to switch to a horizontal direction. She
76.
thinks fast - then slams something in the vicinity of
Melina’s face before she turns -
- and JUMPS out the open door... landing on TOP OF ANOTHER
CUBE. She watches with cruel satisfaction as Quaid and
Melina’s cube above whisks across the chasm.
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR CUBE
CLOSE ON MELINA as she turns fearfully toward what Lori
has left: a MAGNETIC BOMB the size of a hand grenade.
MELINA
Quaid, get over here!
She’s pulling on the Mag bomb to no effect. The display
ticks down “5...4...” seconds left... Quaid spins, peers
out to the chasm and glimpses the approaching wall of an
emerging elevator cube...
QUAID
Come on!
He grabs Melina’s arm and they LEAP in a free-fall...
LANDING HARD atop a descending cube just as - the cube
they escaped from EXPLODES, and -
IS NOW FALLING, huge chunks of DEBRIS threatening to crush
them -
Quaid and Melina brace, desperate for an escape as they
DIVE into the opening of a passing shaft, barely avoiding
IMPACT as the debris DEMOLISHES the cube they were on...
Gasping, they peer out across the vast chasm... to find
Lori far across on the opposite side, eyeing them in a
cold rage.
Quaid and Melina turn and race away.
EXT. EUROMERICAN STREET - DAY
Quaid and Melina move silently, quickly through the
tightly thronged sidewalks. A pair of Sentries begin
heading towards them ...
And they duck immediately to the right into ...
EXT. A MASSIVE OPEN MALL - DAY
A vast emporium of personal electronics. Unable to ignore
as they quickly move through the mobbed mall ...
77.
The faces, words and SOUND-BITES that assault them from
every displayed screen they pass ...
PASSING SCREEN 1
(Newscaster 1)
... as I speak, Synthetic Troops are
being deployed en masse to the China
Fall...
ENDLESS ROWS of SYNTHETIC SOLDIERS with their identical
features standing at attention in identical rows as
MASSIVE TRANSPORT VEHICLES roll up ...
PASSING SCREEN 2
... imminent invasion of New Asia, as new
information has surfaced that directly
implicates the colony’s governing
leadership...
WAVES of lemmings - receiving weapons and, in clock-like
synchronization, boarding trucks ...
Quaid and Melina exchange an alarmed moving glance.
PASSING SCREEN 3
... of the recent dramatic developments,
Chancellor Cohaagen has ordered a fullscale
occupation of New Asia ...
PASSING SCREEN 4
...various rumors circulating. Talk of
martial law...
Quaid and Melina’s look says it all as they exit, swiftly
ducking out the other side of the mall and onto ....
EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
... the sidewalk where, Quaid abruptly stops - riveted by
what he sees on a passing Handheld ...
PASSING HANDHELD
... extraordinary confession of the botline
worker implicated in the murder of
30 Federal Police Sentries in New Asia
yesterday morning ...
He grabs -
QUAID
Melina -
But she is ALREADY STOPPED - staring upward.
78.
He follows her eyes - rising to the JUMBOTRON SCREEN
towering over the crowded square where ...
JUMBOTRON
... captured today following a shootout
at an illegal tripping den ...
He sees HIMSELF: Looming 50 feet tall above the staring
eyes of the crowds. Haggard, beaten and bruised... he
directly addresses the camera:
JUMBOTRON (QUAID)
Euromerica. This is my confession. I
make it under no duress and of my own
free will. My name is Douglas Quaid and
I freely admit that I have long been an
instrument of Quatto; on his orders I
have systematically bombed, gunned and
gassed public institutions in Euromerica,
with the intention of causing maximum
casualties and wreaking havoc...
Quaid, looks astonished to Melina who is equally shocked.
JUMBOTRON (QUAID)
Moreover, I wish to assert that my acts
of terrorism and sabotage - as well as
those of Quatto, Hauser and his
Resistance conspirators - were all
financed and directed by the colonial
government of New Asia in an effort to
bring down the government of Chancellor
Cohaagen...
Melina notices some people are beginning to eye Quaid.
Pale, quiet, she tugs his sleeve - pulling him away.
EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
Heads down, Quaid and Melina move quickly.
QUAID
Cohaagen must have forced me to make the
statement before he finished turning me
into Quaid.
MELINA
Meaning he always planned to do this.
(realizing)
Quatto had warned us that these escalated
attacks meant something. It’s all been
leading up to this...
79.
Quaid looks back at her.
QUAID
We have to get me to Quatto. Fast.
EXT. EUROMERICAN STREETS - DAY
Everything has moved into chaos and overdrive as the
entirety of Euromerican society MOBILIZES FOR WAR.
Sirens scream and mothers duck their children out of the
way as troop transports roar past down the streets ...
EXT. STREET - DAY
Quaid and Melina stop before a massively pristine
industrial facility. DEPARTMENT OF WASTE MANAGEMENT.
Quaid looks askance to Melina.
INT. WASTE MANAGEMENT - DAY
Melina leads Quaid down through a labyrinth of machinery.
Into the utility bowels beneath the clockwork metropolis.
INT. WASTE MANAGEMENT - DAY
They stop at five ARMED MEN who block the way amidst the
roaring machines. They regard Quaid with suspicion.
Quaid recognizes the man he knew as “Murphy” (the mindtrip
advocate from the factory locker room). Murphy nods.
RESISTANCE FIGHTER 1
How can we be sure about him?
MELINA
He successfully activated the message in
Reed’s apartment. Only Hauser could have
done that.
One of the Armed Men runs a SCANNER over Quaid’s body.
RESISTANCE FIGHTER 2
He’s clean.
INT. WASTE MANAGEMENT - QUATTO’S LAIR - DAY
Quaid and Melina follow the armed men into the heart of an
arena of MONSTROUS MACHINES.
80.
Standing solemnly watching VID-SCREENS - broadcasting LIVE
IMAGES of the invasion preparations.
MAN WITH BACK TURNED
Welcome.
He turns. Quatto. The Indian man from the shadowy news
image. Sadly, from behind his spectacles, he smiles.
QUAID
Quatto...
The Elderly Indian Man’s glasses glint.
QUATTO
At last we meet in person, Mr. Quaid.
And not a moment too soon.
He glances at the INVASION PREPARATIONS on the screens.
QUAID
Why is Cohaagen doing this? Why now?
QUATTO
Invade New Asia?
(a rueful smile)
Simple. We’ve outlived our usefulness.
More precisely, the laws he so generously
instituted to keep labor in the hands of
men - rather than machines - have become
obsolete. And inconvenient.
(turns to Quaid and Melina)
Ask yourselves this: what is the one
resource New Asia has that Euromerica
doesn’t?
Quaid thinks about it, his eyes landing on the DENSE
CROWDS of Euromerica on the vid-screens. And it hits him:
QUAID
Space... He’s run out of room...
QUATTO
(smiles sadly)
Indeed. Cohaagen has a great need for
this precious patch of land we still call
home. And yet, even an individual as
persuasive as Cohaagen would have
difficulty convincing the world that the
forced seizure and mass-displacement of
millions is a morally justifiable act.
MELINA
So he created an enemy...
81.
QUATTO
(nods)
And not merely to sway public opinion.
Those attacks were the pretext Cohaagen
needed to manufacture more police synths.
He sold it as “additional security,” when
all along he was amassing an army.
Quatto indicates the vis-screens: the ENDLESS ROWS OF
SYNTHETIC SOLDIERS with their identical features...
QUATTO
And when the occupation is complete,
those same troops will be re-programmed
as factory workers, domestic help, menial
labor - an entire work force who will
never know the meaning of “revolt.”
Quatto steps toward Quaid.
QUATTO
We always knew it was a matter of time
before Cohaagen invented an excuse to
invade us...
He regards one of the vis-screens on which QUAID’S
“CONFESSION” is being replayed.
QUATTO
We just never realized that excuse would
be you.
The notion unnerves Quaid.
QUATTO
Of course we must prepare for war. But
perhaps it can be averted. We must hope
that the weapon Cohaagen designed to
destroy us can now be turned against
him...
(a gentle nod)
And that what we need is inside your
head.
Immediately, lab-coated TECHNICIANS guide Quaid toward a
FUTURISTIC CHAIR - provocatively similar to the one from
the mind-tripping den...
Quaid instinctively backs away. Quatto’s followers start
toward him -- but Quatto halts them with a look.
QUATTO
You have come this far, Mr. Quaid. The
decision must be yours.
82.
Quaid looks from Quatto to Melina... and then proceeds to
take his seat in the chair. Lets them strap him in.
Sensors are attached to the lobes of Quaid’s forehead.
QUATTO
If Cohaagen has been trying to kill you,
we can only assume it was for a reason.
Laying his hand on a SWITCH, he nods - sober.
QUATTO
Let’s find out what it is.
He flicks the switch and Quaid TIGHTENS SPASMODICALLY - an
ENERGY flowing through him ...
Holographic screens dominating one side of the room
suddenly bursting with a pyrotechnic of static...
That begins to coalesce into a flickering collage of
unconnected THOUGHTS, SOUNDS and IMAGES from Quaid’s
mind... Then the image of a TOWERING STEEL DOOR.
QUATTO
The firewall. To the Black Box.
In the room, Quaid’s eyes burst open. A surprised look.
QUATTO
(smiles)
Yes, you’re conscious. Don’t worry.
(nods at screen)
Yes ... you see...?
On the screen, the COMBINATION DIAL on the imaginary door
spins as Quatto enters alphanumerics into the keyboard.
Abruptly, there is a massive THUNKING of tumblers - and
the giant on-screen door of Quaid’s mind swings OPEN to
reveal
A VAST BLACKNESS. Only the faintest hint of a physicality
to it, like a dark labyrinth. We begin to drift forward,
toward the barest suggestion of light glinting far ahead.
MELINA
(confused)
What’s this?
Quaid turns to Quatto - who appears equally unsure as he
peers up at
83.
The holographic screens: we’re still drifting through this
dark, imposing maze, the distant light ahead no closer
despite our encroachment...
QUAID
I thought the box was supposed record
what I saw?
QUATTO
(worried)
It was.
(sees something)
Wait -- there...
Follow Quatto’s gaze to the multiple screens, where
materializing from the blackness we discover
ANOTHER BOX within the box. Plain, black - no locks or
latches.
Intrigued, Quatto uses his equipment to manipulate this
smaller box, and it starts to OPEN...
And instantly every single screen momentarily GLITCHES as
if hit by a massive pulse...
And then, on all the multiple screens, an image of
COHAAGEN’S FACE suddenly appears. Smiling. Mocking us.
MELINA
(on edge)
What’s going on?
COHAAGEN (ON SCREEN)
Hello, Quatto.
(smiles wider)
You can’t imagine how much I’ve looked
forward to meeting you...
They all gape at these multiple images of Cohaagen leering
back at them.
COHAAGEN
After all, you’re a hard man to find.
Alarmed, Quatto quickly calls up a CAT SCAN-STYLE MAP of
Quaid’s brain imagery - and finds a RED DOT PRESENTLY
BLINKING IN HIS CEREBELLUM like a homing signal.
QUAID
(sees this; realizing)
It’s a trap!
84.
THAT RED DOT IN QUAID’S BRAIN-SCAN STILL BLINKING...
Quatto and his men springing into action -
QUATTO
Quick! Shut it all down!
Quatto’s men scrambling to “unplug” Quaid; Quaid himself
ripping the sensors from his own head...
MELINA
(panicked)
I don’t understand -
QUATTO
Cohaagen found the box! It’s wired for
tracking - opening it must have tripped
the signal!
MELINA
You mean there is no weapon?!
Quaid looks over at her, horrified:
QUAID
Melina - I am the weapon.
BANG! Abruptly, the STEEL DOORS on all sides EXPLODE off
their hinges - SENTRIES bursting in - FIRING FULL-AUTO.
Instantly, the ARMED RESISTANCE MEMBERS everywhere in the
room are struck down.
And LORI comes striding in. Smile twisting as she sees
the devastation in Quaid’s eyes...
And then his eyes widen on discovering, entering behind
Lori -
CHANCELLOR VILOS COHAAGEN, his stately veneer coarsened by
a palpable mercilessness: more a General than a
politician.
Cohaagen stops directly in front of Quatto.
COHAAGEN
I had no choice, old man. Your
“Resistance army” would fight to the
death for you, and I can’t have that.
Not when I’ve come this far.
QUATTO
They fight for themselves, not for me.
I am only a man.
85.
COHAAGEN
You shouldn’t underestimate the power of
one man.
Cohaagen then raises his arm - and he’s holding a gun.
COHAAGEN
I know I don’t.
BOOM! he shoots Quatto. As Quatto drops, both Melina and
Quaid - stunned - catch and ...
MELINA
Quatto!
... lower him to the floor. But - gurgling blood - he is
calm. With a dying hand, he touches Melina’s hair ...
Before his eyes move to Quaid’s. Strangely serene:
QUATTO
...It’s up to you now...
He clasps a bloody hand into Quaid’s as he finally dies.
Melina leaps up, throwing herself at Cohaagen.
MELINA
I’LL KILL YOU!
But Lori meets her halfway with a pistolwhipping that
sends Melina sprawling back to the floor. Fanged, Lori
looks to Quaid.
LORI
Bravo. I guess you’ll get another medal
for this.
Before Quaid - furious - can react, Lori nods to the
Sentries who seize Quaid and Melina.
QUAID
(growls)
What’re you waiting for? Why don’t you
just shoot us too?
Cohaagen regards Quaid with an eerily congenial grin.
COHAAGEN
For doing exactly what I wanted you to?
Nonsense. You were always a good
soldier, even when we served together. I
wouldn’t hurt you, Carl. I’m going to
help you.
86.
Lori puts her gun to Melina’s head.
LORI
You, however -
COHAAGEN
No. Not yet. I want to record her
confession first.
(smiles at Quaid)
Maybe I’ll even let you drag it out of
her. Sort of a welcome home present.
QUAID
What are you talking about -
Cohaagen looks to the Sentries - who instantly grab Quaid,
wrestling him into the Resistance’s chair. One of them
snaps open a steel valise, in which we discover various
syringes and high-tech equipment reminiscent of what we
saw in the mind-trip den.
QUAID
Cohaagen! What the hell are you doing?!
COHAAGEN
Maintaining my assets. Carl Hauser was
far too valuable an operative to simply
discard. No - we made sure to back up
your memory in its entirety. We saved it
all - well, up to a point.
(off Quaid’s look)
You see, once we discovered you were
sniffing around the weapons lab, we
realized the unthinkable had happened.
You really had turned.
ON MELINA as her terrified eyes meet Quaid’s -
COHAAGEN
And for a woman, no less.
Quaid seethes, struggling but physically overwhelmed into
the chair, his wrists forcibly strapped to the armrests.
COHAAGEN
But don’t worry... We’ll soon change all
that.
A Technician forces Quaid’s hand over and jams a massive
heavy-gauge NEEDLE into the center of his open palm.
Quaid stifles a scream as Melina struggles frantically.
87.
COHAAGEN
This will neutralize all prior identity
veneers and restore your native brain
chemistry. You’ll be Hauser again. The
same man you were when we first sent you
in. Loyal. Patriotic. Ruthless.
(nods at Melina)
With no memory of these experiences. Or
of anyone you’ve loved.
Quaid looks to Melina, horrified by this possibility -
QUAID
No! I won’t let you! You can’t!
COHAAGEN
Please. I owe you this much. You were
always so ambitious - so eager to make
your mark on this world. And now you
have - even if you didn’t mean to.
Quatto is gone, and the Resistance will
fracture and crumble...
Quaid thrashes, as on the screens in here LIVE IMAGES OF
THE INVASION PREPARATIONS play on. Scary as hell.
COHAAGEN
The future is finally here. And trust
me, the old you is going to love it.
QUAID
Goddamit! Cohaagen!
COHAAGEN
See you soon, my friend.
The fluid enters the black stretch leading to the needle,
Quaid yelling out as it enters his bloodstream.
COHAAGEN
That’s it, Hauser - don’t fight it ...
Quaid screams, veins in his neck bulging, shaking like a
locomotive on fire. His eyes move to the needle and ...
With a massive effort - he begins to CLOSE his fingers...
LORI
Hauser ... ?
FORCING the fat steel needle thru his palm like a
crucifixion nail - emerging spraying out the other side -
As the other BREAKS free of its holding-strap and ...
88.
LORI
VILOS!
Frees the needle-hand. Backhanding the Tech with it, fluidpumping
NEEDLE crunching thru his skull.
And as that man drops Quaid wrenches the needle out and
stabs it into the heart of the nearest Sentry, stripping
the Sentry’s weapon as he falls -
- as Melina seizes the chaos and takes out another Sentry;
now she’s armed too. Shots flying, more Sentries going
down, Lori and Cohaagen emptying rounds -
- as Quaid and Melina shoot their way toward the exit,
ducking out to make a run for it.
INT. DEPARTMENT OF WASTE MANAGEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
Lori, Cohaagen and surviving Sentries racing after them in
pursuit...
EXT. DEPARTMENT OF WASTE MANAGEMENT - DAY
Emerging to where they’d parked their Transport Vehicles --
just in time to see one of their Federal Police Transport
Vehicles FLYING away.
LORI
Shit!
EXT. CHINA FALL - DAY
D-Day before the storming of the beach at Normandy.
ROBOT-LOADERS driving ARMAMENTS - TANKS and TRUCKS and
ARTILLERY up into the holds of the CHINA FALL.
THOUSANDS OF SYNTHETIC TROOPS deploying from vehicles in
precisely ordered rows...
Boarding in waves into the CARGO HOLDS of the China Fall.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Loading capacity - reached. Remaining
troops to travel in - 2nd wave.
Platform clearing for - China Fall drop -
in time minus - five minutes...
Sufficient chaos that no one pays any mind to the
89.
FEDERAL POLICE TRANSPORT VEHICLE that alights on one of
the many LOWERING CARGO HOLDS along the aircraft-carrierlike
docking stage.
INSIDE THE TRANSPORT: QUAID AND MELINA
Undetected, their transport begins lowering into the cargo
hold like so many other arriving crafts.
QUAID
We’ve got to stop this thing before it
makes it to the other side.
MELINA
Okay - how?
QUAID
I may have only been a factory worker for
six weeks, but they made it feel like
years of riding this thing, day in and
day out. Trust me -
(nods, hard)
I’ve got an idea.
INT. COHAAGEN’S CRAFT - FLYING - DAY
Cohaagen and Lori nearing the China Fall below, already
visible through the cockpit glass. Cohaagen on the comm:
COHAAGEN
They’re in a Police Transport. For all
we know they’ve already landed.
EXT. CHINA FALL - DAY
A MILITARY ADJUTANT on the other end.
ADJUTANT
Should we halt departure?
COHAAGEN
No. Stay on course. Just find them.
PUBLIC ADDRESS (IN B.G.)
Drop in - time minus - four minutes.
The Adjutant scans the vast docking stage - and sure
enough, spots the Transport Vehicle with Quaid and Melina
in the cockpit -
- just as the craft sinks below the deck and into the
cargo hold below.
90.
The Adjutant springs into action, grabbing his radio.
ANGLE ON COHAAGEN AND LORI’S CRAFT ABOVE
As it now alights on the deck of the China Fall. Both
Cohaagen and Lori jump out before it even shuts down.
INT. CHINA FALL - MECHANICALS SECTOR
Situated in the “ceiling” of the China Fall. Melina and
Quaid maneuvering dark passages. Keeping close.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Drop in - time minus - two minutes...
Quaid helps Melina duck under a soffit; taking her hand,
he can’t help but notice their shared scar.
He holds her hand in his a beat - tenderly runs a thumb
over the scar they share.
QUAID
I know what he meant to you...
(looks up at her)
But I can never really be Hauser again.
MELINA
(nods; at peace with this)
I didn’t love you for who you were. I
loved you for who you could be.
She blinks back tears as she manages a smile. Quaid pulls
her close, and they hurry on.
INT. CHINA FALL - HALLWAY
Cohaagen and Lori storming halls, searching for Quaid and
Melina.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Drop in - time minus - ninety seconds...
EXT. CHINA FALL - DAY
The perimeter around the CHINA FALL begins to clear as the
remaining THOUSANDS OF SYNTH SOLDIERS are marshalled back.
The last of the crafts lowered into their bays...
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Drop in - time minus - seventy seconds...
91.
INT. CHINA FALL - DAY
Quaid and Melina at a run through gangways - past massive
HANGARS and CARGO HOLDS where THOUSANDS of SYNTHETIC
SOLDIERS are strapping into individual harnesses in
mechanized precision.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Drop in - time minus - sixty seconds...
The pair continue into
A HALLWAY
QUAID
I just need to locate the pressurization
valves...
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Drop in - time minus - thirty seconds...
MELINA
Quaid!
He spins and now sees what she sees: LORI, COHAAGEN and
SYNTHS at the far end of the hall.
They quickly turn, searching for a way out of sight -
COHAAGEN
(now spotting them)
STOP THEM!
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Drop in - time minus - twenty seconds...
Cohaagen, Lori and Synths in pursuit -
Quaid and Melina hurrying back -
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Drop in - time minus - ten seconds...
- only to be blocked by Synth Guards from the other end.
COHAAGEN
Hold it, Quaid! You hold it right there.
They spin - see that Cohaagen and Lori have them dead to
rights. Lori allows a sliver of a smile, about to shoot
when suddenly
A crack like THUNDER...
92.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Time minus zero. China Fall - departing.
EXT. CHINA FALL - LOADING PLATFORMS - DAY
As the monstrous LOCKING BOLTS suddenly withdraw ...
And the entire China Fall suddenly DROPS into its shaft,
vanishing into the earth.
INT. CHINA FALL - HALLWAY - DAY
The FLOOR beneath Quaid, Melina, Lori and Cohaagen
suddenly DROPPING AWAY beneath them ...
As the entire space and everyone in it goes into
WEIGHTLESS FREE-FALL! Bodies drifting every which way -
Quaid suddenly has a thought - FIRES his gun and GRABS
Melina as the gravity-free propulsion VAULTS the two of
them backwards and away...
COHAAGEN
(to Lori)
Get him!
Sides of the steel shaft visible streaking by outside ...
ON QUAID AND MELINA fired by the propulsion of the gun -
propelling out of the hallway and into another.
Craning his neck, Quaid can make out a catwalk leading to
the VAST CARGO HOLD. Quaid catches an I-beam; Melina
hanging on to him, they make their way into
INT. MAIN CARGO HOLD
Quaid quickly BOLT-LOCKS the door behind them.
He and Melina survey the hold. Ceilings high as an
aircraft hangar, as before them stretch ENDLESS ROWS OF
SYNTHETIC SOLDIERS, hundreds secured into individual
transport harnesses.
Quaid spies a SCHEMATIC of the entire China Fall. He
pushes toward it, begins to study the Fall’s layout.
INSERT: JUST OUTSIDE THE CARGO HOLD
LORI tries the door - won’t budge. Cohaagen arrives.
93.
LORI
They locked themselves in the cargo hold.
Cohaagen considers this - has an idea.
COHAAGEN
Stay here and cover the door.
INT. CHINA FALL - SECURITY STATION
Cohaagen enters to a bank of surveillance images.
COHAAGEN
Call up the main cargo hold.
The Cargo Bay image enlarges: see Quaid and Melina in
there... as well as those hundreds of inactive Synths.
Cohaagen realizes he has an opportunity:
COHAAGEN
Activate sentient signals on every synth
we’ve got stored in there; uplink
targeting parameters with unrestricted
kill orders - and release them all.
INT. CHINA FALL - CARGO HOLD
Quaid and Melina suddenly hear something. Quickly turn as
- in a domino-effect - the HARNESS SHOULDER RESTRAINTS
locking down all those Synth Troops begin to LIFT.
A Symphony of combat Synths begin rising into the zeroGravity
void. Quaid freezes, oh shit!
His eyes dart upwards: secured to the stadium-size
ceiling: lots of CARGO CONTAINERS the size of dumpsters.
QUAID
Come on!
ON QUAID as he grabs Melina and shoots his gun to propel
them up to the ceiling - where they take cover behind
those cargo containers. Shots are already ricocheting as
Quaid notices one of the containers labelled “Military
Property.” He quickly snaps its latches, discovers
A CACHE OF WEAPONS. Guns, mag-grenades, etc. Quaid
pockets a grenade - then spots an RPG-type weapon.
Something occurs to him - as below those hundreds of
killer Synths are rising closer... Quaid lunges for a
94.
CONTROL CONSOLE a few feet away. Hits ALL OF THE RELEASE
BUTTONS and
THUNK THUNK THUNK - all the MAGNET LOCKS securing the
containers RELEASE - and those bulky, dumpster-size metal
containers begin to drift into zero-gravity.
Quaid dives back inside the container containing the ammo.
Seizes the RPG and presses it up against a metal strut -
MELINA
What are you doing?!
QUAID
(re: an OPEN CONTAINER
nearby)
Quick, get in there.
MELINA
What are youQUAID
Trust me, I’m right behind you.
Melina pushes off toward the empty container... as Quaid
braces himself and FIRES the RPG...
In zero-G, its rocket propels the entire container off of
Quaid like a sleeve as this dumpster-sized container of
ammo sails down at the rising army of Synthetics -
Quaid lunges for cover inside that empty container with
Melina, pulling her close as below them - the ammo-crate
finally hits the wall below, TRIGGERING the RPG, and
BOOOOOMMMM!! THE BLAST ROCKS THE ENTIRE CHINA FALL,
singeing the metal sides of Quaid and Melina’s container -
EXT. THE CHINA FALL
The entire structure shuddering from the concussive blast
as The Fall continues racing toward the white hot core.
INT. CHINA FALL - CARGO BAY
Smoke and debris. Burnt and mangled Synth parts strewn
everywhere... But as the smoke clears, we find Quaid and
Melina have survived as they drift out from the empty
container that protected them from the blast.
95.
INT. CHINA FALL - SECURITY STATION
Cohaagen witnessing this... sees Quaid and Melina making
for a gaping hole in a wall created by the blast ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE of the China Fall from where Lori waits.
COHAAGEN
They’re headed for the utility corridors.
INT. CHINA FALL - HALLWAY
Through the heat-shielded windows we glimpse walls of the
SHAFT glowing WHITE HOT as the Fall rockets past.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
 Passing - through - core ...
The hallway proceeds to ORBIT as Lori regains her weight.
LORI
(into radio)
I’m on it.
(to Synth troops)
Move!
INT. CHINA FALL - OUTER UTILITY CORRIDOR
QUAID and MELINA back on their feet and running.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Core traversed. Pressurizing for sealevel
New Asia. You may experience -
some discomfort.
Hearing this - Quaid halts: revisiting an idea.
QUAID
Wait - this way.
He pulls her down an auxiliary corridor as he fishes out
one of those mag-grenades he’d grabbed from that crate.
INT. CHINA FALL - UTILITY CORRIDOR
Quaid PLANTS the grenade on a MASSIVE PIECE OF MACHINERY.
QUAID
Come on.
96.
ANGLE ON A SERIES OF VALVES
Quaid inspects them a beat, then begins to spin the valve
wheels, one after the next...
INT. CHINA FALL - OUTER UTILITY CORRIDOR
A squadron of SYNTH TROOPS arriving. Security-cam style
images on the inside of their face-shields replay images
of Quaid and Melina having just run down this corridor.
INT. UTILITY CORRIDOR - DAY
The Synths enter. Fan out, weapons ready. Sure enough,
the Lead Synth spots Quaid and Melina some 100 yards down
the corridor, turns to inform the others -
- when his “eyes” detect the Mag-grenade Quaid left just
as it EXPLODES! blasting the Synths to pieces.
ON QUAID AND MELINA as they start to hurry out - when they
hear Lori’s voice approaching...
INT. CHINA FALL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR
Lori leading her charge, reacting to wafting smoke ahead.
LORI
This way!
INT. CHINA FALL - UTILITY CORRIDOR
Quaid and Melina anxiously weighing their options -
MELINA
They’ve got eyes everywhere on this
thing.
QUAID
(a thought)
Not everywhere.
INT. CHINA FALL - OUTER CORRIDOR LEADING TO UTILITIES
Lori and her squad racing into
THE UTILITIES CORRIDOR
But there’s no sign of Quaid or Melina?
97.
INT. CHINA FALL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR
Quaid and Melina standing before an EMERGENCY EXIT HATCH,
Quaid handling it to determine how it opens.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Arrival in New Asia in - 4 minutes...
Quaid sees how scared Melina looks.
MELINA
You know, the windows don’t open on this
thing for a reason.
QUAID
(reassuring)
Just hang on tight and don’t look down...
Or up.
(braced)
Ready?
She nods anxiously - and he seizes the hatch and yanks it
open with a sudden blast of air to reveal THE EXTERIOR of
the China Fall - as AN ALARM immediately sounds.
The rush of air incredibly intense as Quaid ventures up
through the hatch and outside to
THE EXTERIOR OF THE CHINA FALL!
Quaid manages to hang on to a maintenance rung as he
reaches for Melina and helps her out here. The rush of
air terrifying as she too hangs on to the rungs...
AND THEY START TO CLIMB PRECARIOUSLY ALONG THE SIDE OF THE
CHINA FALL, TOWARD THE TOP. Only a few feet of space
separating them from the shaft wall screaming past. Wind
pummeling them relentlessly. It’s like climbing along the
top of a bullet train going through a tunnel. Only
travelling straight UP.
INT. CHINA FALL - SECURITY STATION
The same alarm sounding in here. The Adjutant checks it.
ADJUTANT
We’ve got an exterior access breach in
sector 38-J. It has to be them.
Cohaagen squinting anxiously at the various interior
angles on the security images.
98.
ADJUTANT
It’s no use, sir. We’re blind out there.
(not the answer Cohaagen was
looking for)
But a climb like that, it’s suicide.
INT. CHINA FALL - EMERGENCY EXIT HATCH
Lori arriving, yanks open the hatch, braving the intensity
of the air blasting at her - and squints down the length
of the Fall... just making out the figures of Quaid and
Melina high above, still managing to scale the side of the
Fall.
Lori drops back inside, grabs her radio:
LORI
They’re heading topside!
EXT. CHINA FALL
Quaid and Melina straining as they continue their
harrowing ascent, climbing hand over hand as they force
themselves to ignore the punishing wind and the shaft wall
screaming just past their heads...
INT. CHINA FALL - OTHER CORRIDORS
Cohaagen marches, barking at his Adjutant -
COHAAGEN
They are not getting off the Fall alive,
understand?
EXT. CHINA FALL
The shaft screaming past as we find Quaid and Melina
finally arriving at
THE TOP OF THE FALL
A VAST, MULTI-TIERED STRETCH of landing areas, bay lifts,
etc. Quaid and Melina pull themselves over the edge, and
proceed to climb along the “roof,” as The China Fall
continues shooting up toward the dim, grey LIGHT spilling
down from New Asia just above.
99.
INT. CHINA FALL - CORRIDORS
Lori and troops sprint through empty passenger areas ...
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Please remain in your seats ... Arrival
in - two minutes ...
Outside the sides of the shaft can be seen beginning to
slow as the Fall approaches New Asia.
EXT. CHINA FALL - TOP OF THE SHAFT
The Fall still slowing as it nearly completes its ascent.
Quaid and Melina arrive at a BAY DOOR along one of many
tiers. Already damp from the misty rains of New Asia.
MELINA
Are you sure this plan of yours will
work?
QUAID
It better.
Quaid opens the bay door, revealing a descending passage.
Melina goes first, Quaid about to follow when
SHOTS RING OUT and a BULLET TEARS into Quaid’s shoulder!
MELINA
No!
Quaid spins, sees FOUR SYNTH GUARDS across the “roof,”
marching toward him... and behind them: COHAAGEN.
QUAID
(to Melina)
Go! Get down there.
MELINA
No! I won’t leave you!
QUAID
You have to! I’ll keep them busy. GO!
More shots fired, Quaid ducks behind the tier, wincing.
Their love for each other palpable - as is their
realization they may never see each other again...
QUAID
Melina, we have no choice! You have to
go now!
100.
Melina hesitates - fighting every instinct to stay, she
forces herself to leave him, hurrying through the bay door
and shutting it behind her.
Fighting back the pain from his shoulder-wound, Quaid
fires back at Cohaagen and his Synths.
INT. CHINA FALL - UPPER PASSENGER DECKS
A SYNTH sees an image inside his helmet, spins to Lori:
SYNTH SENTRY
Movement detected in the craft bay.
INT. CHINA FALL - CRAFT BAY
Melina alone in the dark and eerie quiet. Rows and rows of
vehicles, futuristic-jets, choppers, etc - all SECURED and
awaiting off-loading.
PUBLIC ADDRESS
Arrival in - 20 seconds -
Melina races ahead. On a mission. Searching the dark...
EXT. TOP OF THE CHINA FALL
Quaid still shooting it out with Cohaagen and his Synths.
Manages to take out two of the Synths -
- and then realizes he’s just run out of ammo. Shit!
He clutches his wounded shoulder, peers out anxiously at
NEW ASIA coming into view all around him, as the top of
the China Fall rises higher and higher above ground to
meet the enormous rain-swept PLATFORM looming overhead.
It finally does, coming gently to a stop.
THREE MASSIVE LOCKING BOLTS slam into place, securing the
China Fall to the New Asia Passenger Platform.
A moment’s stillness as the acidic rain hammers down.
COHAAGEN
Quaid.
Quaid winces at his useless weapon.
101.
INT. CHINA FALL - CRAFT BAY
Doors burst open as Lori and her Troops storm in. Lightmounts
on their weapons sweeping the dark array of
vehicles. No sign of Melina yet...
EXT. TOP OF THE CHINA FALL
Quaid cornered... as Cohaagen draws his gun, nearing.
COHAAGEN
(calling out)
So you made a dent in my first wave; I’ve
got thousands more troops awaiting
deployment.
ON QUAID tensing in his crouch.
COHAAGEN (O.S.)
You need to accept the fact that no
matter what you do, it won’t make a
difference. The era of good will is
over...
Cohaagen coming nearer and nearer to Quaid’s position -
silently signaling his Synths to flank him...
COHAAGEN
Starting now.
He nods to his Synths, and they start to FIRE on Quaid’s
position - bullets sparking off the metal struts he hides
behind.
INT. CHINA FALL - CRAFT BAY
Lori and her troops still searching the crafts -- when
suddenly from behind Lori
A FUTURISTIC ATTACK CHOPPER comes awake.
INSIDE THE ATTACK CHOPPER we find Melina at the helm,
rapidly punching in communication to activate the bay
hatch above her... which slides open as the entire
PLATFORM STARTS TO RISE -
Lori and her team fire on the chopper furiously as it
continues to rise up through the hatch...
102.
EXT. TOP OF THE CHINA FALL
Cohaagen and his Synths still firing on Quaid when THE
FLOOR RISES BEHIND THEM as Melina’s chopper emerges from
below (note: it’s not flying; skids are secured to the
platform) - taking them completely by surprise!
Quaid seizes the confusion and makes a run for it. Sees
Melina through the chopper’s windshield and shouts:
QUAID
Melina NOW!
INSIDE THE ATTACK CHOPPER
Melina nods - she spins her target sites until she lands
squarely on ONE OF THE THREE MASSIVE HOLDING CLAMPS that
secure the China Fall to the New Asia Platform.
Melina fires off a mini-missile directly into the enormous
holding clamp and...
BOOOOMM!! The clamp erupts, losing its grip on its
section of The China Fall -
THE CHINA FALL LURCHES like the Leaning Tower of Pisa -
- Cohaagen’s Synths toppling along the edge of the Fall’s
top, trying to regain their footing -
- unlike Quaid, who knew this was coming, and already
found rungs to hold on to.
BACK TO MELINA
As she lines up the next MASSIVE HOLDING CLAMP in her
sites. Fires a SECOND MINI-MISSILE and BOOOOMMM!! Takes
out the SECOND MASSIVE HOLDING CLAMP!
The top of the China Fall lurches even more violently -
INT. CHINA FALL - CRAFT BAY
Lori and Troops tumbling and sliding across the canting
floor, smacking into the secured crafts -
EXT. TOP OF THE CHINA FALL
- AS COHAAGEN AND HIS SYNTHS TOPPLE RIGHT OFF THE EDGE OF
THE CHINA FALL!
103.
QUAID
(shouts to Melina)
Come on!!
MELINA LEAPS out of her attack chopper, racing across the
rain-slicked, slanted rooftop to
Quaid awaiting her - together they make a run across the
top of the lurching Fall as above -
THE LAST OF THE ATTACHED MASSIVE HOLDING CLAMPS CREAKS
VIOLENTLY, unable on its own to withstand the incredible
strain of the entire China Fall for much longer.
Its bolts start to snap, long swaths of solid structure
BENDING from the sheer force of the Fall’s weight... going
to snap off at any moment...
QUAID AND MELINA RUNNING toward the canted edge of the
Fall’s top, arriving directly beneath that huge straining
holding clamp above that’s about to rip free any second -
QUAID
JUMP!
- and together they LEAP OFF THE EDGE of the China Fall -
- GRABBING onto the New Asia Platform itself just as THE
FINAL HOLDING CLAMP BREAKS from the China Fall -
- and the China Fall abruptly vanishes from beneath us and
PLUMMETS IN FREE-FALL BACK DOWN INTO THE SHAFT!
INT. CHINA FALL - CRAFT BAY
Lori and the surviving Synths SLAM to the bay ceiling with
the sudden jolt -
INT. CHINA FALL SHAFT
- as the China Fall races away at incredible speed,
heading back toward the other side of the Earth!
EXT. NEW ASIA - CHINA FALL PLATFORM - DAY
Quaid manages to pull himself to safety, reaches for
Melina -
- when she SLIPS on the rain-slicked surface and FALLS!
She drops some 50 feet before just managing to GRAB ON to
one of the platform’s vertical support struts.
104.
Quaid’s heart in his throat as he shouts down over rain:
QUAID
Melina!! Just hang on!
INT. CHINA FALL SHAFT
THE CHINA FALL racing past us at an unholy velocity...
EXT. CHINA FALL LOADING DOCK - EUROMERICA SIDE - NIGHT
While on the other side of the planet 15,000 SYNTHETIC
TROOPS stand massed waiting the return of the China Fall.
INT. CHINA FALL - CARGO BAY - DAY
Lori braces herself on the catwalk above the cargo bay -
wreckage of those hundreds of Synth troops strewn
everywhere.
As WARNING ALARMS blare in numerous languages:
LORI
Can’t we stop it?!
She turns to COHAAGEN’S ADJUTANT, standing at a console,
shaking his head, ghost white.
VOICE
No... And we’ve got a bigger problem.
That lands with Lori. Bigger than this??
EXT. NEW ASIA - CHINA FALL PLATFORM
Quaid crouched on the platform above, anxiously watching
Melina below trying her best to climb back up, the rainslicked
metal making it all the more treacherous...
A few feet above her is a tubular alcove that connects to
the next strut. She manages to make it there, takes a
breath - and then GASPS on seeing through that long
stretch of alcove
COHAAGEN, battered but alive! Somehow he made the jump
from the Fall’s side to one of the Platform struts. And
now he’s climbing up toward the Platform itself - unseen
by Quaid!
105.
Melina tries to scream a warning up to Quaid, but her
voice can’t compete with the relentless wind and rain...
INT. CHINA FALL - UTILITY CORRIDOR
LORI and COHAAGEN’S ADJUTANT hold there ground, staring at
the piece of MACHINERY Quaid blew with the magnetic
grenade.
Yelling over the SOUND of a now SCREECHING China Fall:
LORI
I don’t understand! What is it?
ADJUTANT
It’s the depressurizing valve.
LORI
Depressurizing? I don’t get it. We
pressurized before we arrived in New
Asia.
ADJUTANT
Yes. That’s because he didn’t blow up
the valves that create pressure.
(swallows)
Just the ones that release it.
More WARNINGS blare from the P.A. system.
LORI
Just tell me what the hell it means!
ADJUTANT
It means - we’re going to arrive back in
Euromerica - at elevation of 9,000 plus
feet - with sea-level pressurization.
LORI
(not getting it)
And? And?? Why is that important??
ADJUTANT
It’s important - because the China Fall
isn’t built for it. When it no longer has
the walls of the shaft to support it ...
(escalating)
...it’s going to explode like a goddamn
bomb!
Now Lori suddenly gets it. She spins on the Adjutant.
106.
LORI
There must be something we can do?!
ADJUTANT
I - I don’t think so -
Panicked, Lori jams a gun to the Adjutant’s head.
LORI
Think harder! You need to fix this!
ADJUTANT
I - I can’t...!
EXT. NEW ASIA - CHINA FALL PLATFORM
Quaid still at a crouch, trying to decipher what Melina is
screaming up at him. Finally makes out “Cohaagen!” --
When he senses someone behind him. Turns and
WHAM! Gets a boot in the face from Cohaagen, sliding back
across the rain-slicked platform. In seconds Cohaagen is
on him and, given Quaid’s wounded shoulder, proves a true
match as they proceed to brutally fight...
EXT. CHINA FALL LOADING DOCK - EUROMERICA SIDE - NIGHT
A tremendous UPDRAFT sends winds cycloning ahead of the
arrival of the China Fall in Euromerica ....
Whipping round the columns of AMASSED COMBAT SYNTHS ...
INT. CHINA FALL - DAY
LORI is RUNNING as BOLTS from the Fall’s interior walls
begin to blow their rivets - firing out like bullets
everywhere...
Then skids to a halt as a horrible rending sound shrieks
through the entirety of the China Fall around her.
LORI
... Oh no ...
EXT. CHINA FALL LOADING DOCK - EUROMERICA SIDE - NIGHT
With an eruption of sound, like a great god emerging out
of the earth ... The China Fall rises like Godzilla from
out of the ground, higher and higher, until it SLAMS
107.
VIOLENTLY INTO THE MASSIVE LOCKING BOLTS atop the platform
--
Metal TWISTING and BUCKLING, but amazingly still manages
to catch hold. A profound silence follows ...
INT. CHINA FALL
Lori screams.
LORI
Quaid!
EXT. CHINA FALL LOADING DOCK - EUROMERICA SIDE - NIGHT
Like a monstrous 30 story bomb, the entirety of the China
Fall DETONATES ...
Sending a shockwave of glass and metal decimating through
the columns of Synth troops massed there ...
Flattening them into a Hiroshima of steel and plastic.
Instantaneously - a WHIRLWIND forms - as AIR begins
sucking down into the vacuum of the CHINA FALL SHAFT ...
Debris and loose objects and remains of tens of thousands
of decimated robots - sucked vanishing into it.
INT. CHINA FALL
A GIANT COLUMN of AIR comes screaming at gargantuan volume
through the shaft, from one side of the world ...
Headed toward the other.
EXT. NEW ASIA - CHINA FALL PLATFORM
Quaid and Cohaagen still battling it out. Cohaagen’s
military background evident in his fighting skills.
Quaid’s shoulder wound not helping matters any.
Cohaagen finally manages to SLAM Quaid on his back and
clasps both hands to Quaid’s throat, strangling him...
INT. CHINA FALL SHAFT
The tidal wave of OXYGEN shrieks past as it shoots upwards
towards the surface above.
108.
EXT. NEW ASIA - CHINA FALL PLATFORM
That approaching tidal wave causing a faint rumbling to
register up here. Climbing up to try to help Quaid,
Melina now becomes aware of it -
But on the platform above, Cohaagen is oblivious, focused
solely on choking the life out of Quaid.
COHAAGEN
You thought - you could beat me?! Who do
you think taught you how to fight?
(sneering)
I almost - pity you. You’re about to
die - without ever knowing - who you
really are.
The rumbling growing louder as Quaid barely gasps back:
QUAID
I know... who I am.
COHAAGEN
(scoffs)
You’re not Quaid.
QUAID
No... and I’m not Hauser either...
COHAAGEN
Then who are you?
That hangs for a profound beat - Quaid, renewed, meets his
eyes with a determined glare - then suddenly rallies every
bit of strength and KICKS Cohaagen off him -- sending
Cohaagen stumbling back and OFF THE PLATFORM’S EDGE just
as
VVVVWWWOOOOSSHHH!! A volcanic ERUPTION from the China
Fall shaft - gigantic chunks of MACHINERY cartwheeling
hundreds of feet... the eruption catching Cohaagen’s body
with it and flinging him straight up into oblivion as
The SPEWING GEYSER of OXYGEN - aqua-colored and pure -
erupts massively up into the polluted sky.
ON MELINA clinging to the strut as she gapes in awe...
ON QUAID
as he too stares at this odd miracle, the surreal sight of
the bright, clean air around the platform blowing away
polluted sky in all directions...
109.
Quaid gazes in amazement.
SAME - MOMENTS LATER
As the bulk of the gusting settles, Quaid is finally
pulling Melina up to the platform. She gratefully enters
his arms, catching her breath.
MELINA
All those lies Cohaagen told us about
some day cleaning up this place... you
made them true.
She peers around at the clearing skies of New Asia.
Brilliant ... BLUE.
MELINA
(marvelling)
I feel like I’m dreaming.
Quaid nods - and then something about this sentiment
causes his smile to falter just a moment. Something
occurring to him...
He peers down at his arm, and ROLLS UP his sleeve to
regard the spot in the crook of his elbow where -
FLASH ON: THE TRIPPING DEN
THWACK! that PEACE SYMBOL is punch-gunned onto his skin
for use as a bulls-eye -
TIGHT ON QUAID as he peers down at the same site to find
the skin is unblemished. No Peace symbol in evidence.
Quaid peers down uneasily, thumbs the skin - could be the
rain washed it off? Could be it faded? Or... could be...
MELINA
Hey - you okay?
Quaid quickly glances up at her -
MELINA
What is it?
Quaid hesitates an instant - and then smiles.
QUAID
Nothing.
Melina senses there’s more behind that - but Quaid disarms
her concern with a kiss. He holds her gaze, just
110.
appreciating the beauty of her and of this moment - real
or illusion, this is where he chooses to be.
Off of Melina’s smile we CRANE BACK...
Witnessing the full extent of the oxygen’s repair over New
Asia. Expanding. Rebuilding.
The beginning of a new era.
FADE OUT.
END
