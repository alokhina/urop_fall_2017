READERS' NOTE --
The characters of Leon S. Kennedy, Ada Wong, Barry Burton and
Sergei are all taken from the Resident Evil games.
All creatures/undead in the screenplay are also taken directly
from the game.
1 DARKNESS -- 1
The sound of a human heartbeat. Slow. Irregular.
Barely alive.
ALICE (V.O.)
My name is Alice. I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation in a
secret high tech facility called
The Hive. It was a laboratory,
developing experimental viral
weaponry. There was an incident,
a virus escaped and everybody
died. Trouble was ... they
didn’t stay dead.
The dark silhouette of a woman’s body drifts away from
us, revealing that we are --
2 DEEP UNDERWATER -- 2
As the body drifts upwards towards the light, we see
that the surface of the water is ON FIRE - burning
gasoline everywhere.
ALICE (V.O.)
This was the start of an
apocalypse that would sweep the
entire World.
3 EXT. SURFACE OF THE OCEAN DAY. 3
Amidst the flame, the body of the woman - ALICE -
breaks the surface and then RISES OUT OF THE WATER.
Seemingly levitating into the air.
We realize now that the image is playing in REVERSE.
We are going back in time.
As Alice rises higher and higher into the air, blazing
pieces of wreckage begin to pull themselves from the
water and levitate around her.
Gobs of fire raining UPWARDS into the sky.
ALICE (V.O.)
A last handful of survivors
sought safety on a ship called
Arcadia. We thought it was a
safe haven. We thought it was
free from infection. But we
were wrong ... 
4 EXT. DECK OF THE ARCADIA DAY. 4
We recognize this ship from the end of RE4. It is the
Arcadia, the Umbrella vessel which Alice liberated and
which was just about to be attacked by Jill Valentine
and her fleet of V-22 helicopters.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
as she rises over the railing of the ship. Directly in
front of her, we witness the epic SLOW MOTION sight of
a massive explosion COLLAPSING IN ON ITSELF. Blazing
fire and wreckage consume themselves. We are watching
the REVERSE CRASH of a V-22 helicopter --
Shattered chunks of twisted debris slide backwards
across the deck, reforming themselves into the
fuselage.
Rotor blades spin backwards, attaching themselves to
the reconstituted V-22.
Shattered shards of glass reform into the windshield.
As the V-22 reassembles itself before our eyes, we WHIP
PAN to --
ALICE
As she lands on the deck. Two sawn-off SHOTGUNS spin
through the air and land neatly in her hands.
Remember, everything is still playing in reverse.
ON THE HELICOPTER --
As the now fully reconstituted V-22 rises back up into
the air.
5 INT. V-22 HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS 5
CLOSE ON the dead PILOT as blood runs up his face and
back into his mouth. His eyes spring open and he comes
back to life as a dozen SILVER QUARTERS emerge from his
body.
The windshield in front of him reforms as the silver
quarters pass back through it. Spiderwebs of cracks in
the glass erase themselves.
As the V-22 rises back into the sky, we WHIP PAN to --
ALICE
2.
(CONTINUED)
As the stream of silver quarters fly through the air
towards her and neatly stack themselves back within the
barrels of her shotguns.
We WHIP PAN from Alice to -- *
*
JILL VALENTINE
As she free-falls BACK UP INTO THE SKY. A rappelling
cable trailing behind her as she arcs back up towards
the helicopter from which she jumped.
Her guns are out, long muzzle flashes withdrawing into
their barrels as dozens of spent shells spin back into
her guns and re-chamber themselves. Above her, the sky
is black with circling helicopters.
WHIP PAN to --
ALICE *
Shotguns now holstered and two machine pistols in hand. *
Running across the deck in reverse, muzzle flashes *
withdrawing back into her gun. *
CLOSE ON -- Freshly ejected shells picking themselves *
up off the floor, arcing through the air and re- *
chambering themselves in Alice’s pistol. *
WHIP PAN to -- *
A SURVIVOR lying prone on the deck of the ship, wrapped *
in a ballistic nylon net, pulled tightly around her. *
We watch in reverse, as she rises back to her feet, the *
net unfurls around her and flies back to the gun which *
had fired it - held by a menacing, black clad UMBRELLA *
TROOPER. *
WHIP PAN to -- *
HELICOPTER SHOT -- *
Of dozens of Umbrella troopers as they rise up off the
deck of the ship, seemingly pulled by their rappelling
cables, fly through the air, and step back into the
hovering V-22s. *
6 EXT. DECK OF THE ARCADIA - CONTINUOUS 6
Everything still playing in REVERSE.
White clad SURVIVORS fly backwards through the air
towards giant explosions, that in turn collapse in on
themselves and reform into MISSILES. These missiles
then streak backwards towards the hovering V-22s which
fired them. *
3.
5 CONTINUED: 5
7 HELICOPTER SHOT -- 7 *
Of the Arcadia surrounded by a fleet of Umbrella V-22s.
This is the very end of the last shot of RE4 - but now *
it is playing in reverse.
The helicopters fly backwards past the camera,
disappearing from view - leaving the Arcadia alone in *
the tranquil Ocean - a quiet moment of peace. *
THE IMAGE FREEZES.
ALICE (V.O.)
Once again, the Umbrella
Corporation had deceived us.
And once again, myself and my
friends, found ourselves
fighting ... for our lives ...
The words hang there for a moment. Then suddenly --
We return to live action. The same shot - the end shot
of RE4 - but now playing FORWARDS --
A menacing fleet of Umbrella V-22 helicopters HURTLE *
past the camera. *
EXT. DECK OF THE ARCADIA - CONTINUOUS *
In quick succession we watch a replay of the opening *
sequence, but now all playing FORWARDS and in REAL
TIME, not slow motion. *
Explosions rock the deck of the ship, sending white *
clad Survivors flying.
Dozens of heavily armed UMBRELLA TROOPERS leap from the
helicopters and rappel down onto the deck of the ship.
They shoot CAPTURE NETS at the survivors, snaring many
of them. *
Jill Valentine rappels down, shooting at Alice as she *
goes.
Alice dodges Jill’s bullets and returns fire. *
An incoming V-22 lines up its sights on Alice.
Alice turns and fires her shotguns.
The silver quarters find their mark, punching through
the windshield of the V-22 and killing the Pilot.
The stricken V-22 crashes into the deck of the Arcadia,
tearing itself apart in a massive explosion.
4.
(CONTINUED)
The force of the explosion hurls Alice off the deck of
the ship.
Surrounded by blazing debris, Alice tumbles to the icy
waters below.
Seen from beneath the waves, Alice impacts with the
surface of the water. Now unconscious, her prone body
begins to sink.
Above her, the surface of the water is ablaze with
burning gasoline.
ALICE *
My name is Alice ...
Alice’s dark silhouette drifts towards the camera. We
hear the sound of her heartbeat. Slow. Irregular.
Barely alive.
ALICE (CONT’D)
And this is my story ...
As her dark silhouette engulfs us, we FADE TO BLACK,
and the HEART BEAT STOPS.
ALICE (CONT’D)
... the story of how I died.
CUT TO
BLACK:
8 CLOSE ON ALICE’S EYE -- 8
As she awakens. The signature Resident Evil shot.
PULL BACK to REVEAL that she is lying on the bed of a --
9 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - BEDROOM DAY. 9 *
TODD (O.S.)
Rise and shine.
Alice turns. Glances across the rumpled sheets of a
double bed to see TODD. Mid thirties. Pleasant,
reliable. Like the home, he has an iconic American *
look to him. Todd is agitated - pulling on his boxer *
shorts and dressing in a hurry. He wears a wedding
ring. One that matches Alice’s.
TODD (CONT’D)
Come on, we’re late ... Alarm
didn’t go off. Becky isn’t up
yet. Mrs. Henderson’s going to
be pissed. You know how they
get at school when we drop her
off late.
5.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Alice rubs her eyes. Tired. Disoriented.
TODD (CONT’D)
Baby!!
He stops dressing. Sees that Alice hasn’t moved --
TODD (CONT’D)
(concerned)
Baby? Are you okay?
ALICE
Yeah. I’ll get Becky up.
TODD
You look tired. You didn’t
sleep well?
ALICE
I’m fine.
TODD
(not convinced)
You’re sure?
ALICE
Yeah.
He stares at her. The way husbands stare at their
wives.
ALICE (CONT’D)
I’m okay ... really.
TODD
Well in that case ...
He whips the bedclothes off --
TODD (CONT’D)
... get that cute ass out of
bed.
Alice rises. Catches sight of herself in a mirror --
She has RED hair now.
10 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - LATER 10 *
CU JUICER. Alice is making fresh orange juice.
She places a glass on the breakfast bar in front of
BECKY. Seven years old, cute, smart - has her mom’s *
eyes.
ALICE
You want oatmeal?
6.
9 CONTINUED: 9
(CONTINUED)
BECKY
Pancakes?
ALICE
Cereal?
BECKY
Pancakes?
ALICE
Cereal then pancakes?
BECKY
Deal.
Todd enters, coffee in hand. Dressed in a crisp white
shirt and dark suit.
TODD
You know we’re late, right?
BECKY
I have to have a good breakfast.
(quotes from an
ad...)
“Nutritious and delicious.”
Todd pours himself another cup of coffee. Takes a
swig. MACRO SHOT -- Two little drops of coffee fall on
his crisp white shirt.
TODD
Shit ...
ALICE/BECKY
Language!!
Alice examines the damage --
ALICE
There’s another shirt in your
closet.
TODD
I don’t think so.
ALICE
At the back.
He doesn’t look convinced.
ALICE (CONT’D)
I picked up the dry cleaning
yesterday.
TODD
You’re my angel.
7.
10 CONTINUED: 10
(CONTINUED)
ALICE
Don’t you forget it.
The two kiss.
BECKY
(disgust)
Please ... get a room.
Todd walks into the living room, headed for the
bedroom. He stops. The front door is wide open.
That’s odd.
WITHOUT WARNING AN UNDEAD LEAPS AT TODD.
TODD
Aaaaah!!
Todd reels back. A bite mark in his arm. Blood
spreading across the crisp white shirt. Becky SCREAMS
as her father fights with the Undead.
ALICE
Todd!!!
Todd flings the Undead away. It crashes through a
glass table. But is on its feet in an instant.
TODD
Get Becky away!!
In an instant the Undead is on him.
Alice steps back, Becky in her arms, unsure of what to
do. Suddenly an EXPLOSION of glass behind her. Alice
turns to see another Undead, clawing for her, caught
momentarily in the remains of the kitchen screen door.
A third Undead races through the open front door -
comes straight at her.
11 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 11 *
Alice slams the door in the face of the Undead.
There’s no lock on the door. She holds it closed as
best she can, but they want in.
BECKY
Mommy!!! What’s happening?!!
Where’s Daddy!?
Alice can’t hold the door much longer. Instead, she
lets go, and pulls over a shelving unit. Bottles of
conditioner and boxes of Tide go everywhere, but the
shelves fall across the door, jamming it for a moment.
8.
10 CONTINUED: (2) 10
(CONTINUED)
The Undead reach through the gap, but can’t quite
squeeze through. Their arms claw the air wildly -
reaching for Alice and Becky.
Alice looks around desperately. There’s one tiny
window in the laundry room. Alice grabs a small
stepladder and carries it to the window.
12 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 12 *
Alice’s face appears at the laundry window, she knocks
the mesh screen away and her arm pokes through. That’s
all she can fit. The window is tiny. Even Becky
couldn’t squeeze through.
13 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 13 *
Alice jumps down from the stepladder.
BECKY
Mommy!!!
Becky points to the door. The Undead are hammering at
it, slowly shifting the shelving unit. The gap is
getting wider - soon they will be in.
Alice casts around desperately. Nothing but solid
walls.
She looks up.
14 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - ATTIC 14 *
A moment of calm. It’s dark up here. The sound of the
chaos below is muffled. The CAMERA tracks across the
rafters of the suburban bungalow.
Suddenly the handle of a MOP punches through the
ceiling of the house. Again and again it hammers
through the ceiling causing shafts of light to pour
through from below. Alice’s hands CLAW through the
weakened ceiling and begin to tear pieces of it down -
opening a jagged hole big enough for her to force her
head through.
15 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 15 *
Alice jumps down off the stepladder, grabs Becky and
forces her through the hole in the ceiling.
ALICE
Grab a hold. Climb!!
9.
11 CONTINUED: 11
(CONTINUED)
Behind Alice the shelving unit collapses - the door is
almost open. The Undead claw at her, their fingers
grabbing at her clothing.
ALICE (CONT’D)
Climb!!
Becky disappears into the attic. Alice follows close
behind as the door bursts open and the Undead rush in.
16 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - ATTIC/LAUNDRY ROOM - 16 *
CONTINUOUS
Alice is half through the hole, but it is too tight.
Below, the Undead grabs at her legs. She KICKS them
away. The stepladder goes flying and Alice’s legs
flail. She almost falls. An Undead grabs her foot,
gets ready to take a bite. She kicks it away and it
SLAMS into the washing machine, smashing the glass and
sending soapy water everywhere. As more Undead pour
into the laundry, with a Herculean effort, Alice pulls
herself up --
ALICE
Aaaaah!!
As the Undead grab for her, she disappears into the
ceiling above.
17 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 17 *
Alice rolls onto her side, exhausted. A beat of calm.
Then Becky’s face suddenly appears beside her. Alice
can’t help but jump.
BECKY
Mommy!! I think there’s
something up here ...
18 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - ATTIC - MOMENTS LATER 18 *
Alice peers around a corner, Becky behind her, ready
for trouble. The attic is a maze of storage boxes, old
strollers, car seats etc. Anything could be hiding up
here.
Alice advances. She sees a box of old sporting
equipment. Takes out a baseball bat. Hefts it.
Up ahead - a noise - WHEEZING BREATH.
ALICE
(to Becky)
Get behind me ...
10.
15 CONTINUED: 15
(CONTINUED)
The noise is getting louder. Coming from behind a pile
of cardboard boxes. Alice advances. Her fingers
tighten on the bat. White knuckles. The tension
unbearable ...
Alice rounds the corner and sees --
THE WATER HEATER. The true source of the noise.
19 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CORRIDOR 19 *
A hatch in the ceiling opens and Alice’s eyes appear.
She gazes around. The corridor seems empty. Silently,
Alice drops the retracting ladder down from the hatch.
She climbs down it as stealthily as she can. Every
creak of the metal ladder potentially giving away their
position. Alice makes it to the bottom. Baseball bat
still in hand. She glances into an apparently empty
living room at the end of the corridor.
Alice signals to Becky. She’s scared. Doesn’t want to
move. Alice signals to her again. After a moment’s
hesitation, Becky begins to climb down. Terrified.
Both girls are now in the corridor. The house is
silent. Becky turns and KNOCKS a side table. A vase
tumbles off it headed for the floor --
CLOSE ON THE VASE
As Alice catches it. Inches from the hardwood floor.
Water slops out, a couple of flowers fall silently.
But Alice has averted disaster. She places it quietly
back on the table as --
BAM!!!!!
A bedroom door slams open and an Undead races out.
Becky screams as Alice grabs her and races down the
corridor.
20 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 20 *
Back in Alice and Todd’s bedroom. Back where we
started. Alice slams the door in the Undead’s face,
and locks it. SMASH!! The Undead’s arm PUNCHES
straight through the door, splintering the wood.
ALICE
The window!! Quick!!
Becky runs to the window. Struggles with the latch.
Can’t undo it in her panic. Alice helps, opens the
window and pushes Becky out, as behind her, the bedroom
door gives way. The Undead charges and meets --
11.
18 CONTINUED: 18
(CONTINUED)
ALICE’S BASEBALL BAT
In full swing. The Undead is taken off its feet. Its
prone body SLAMS to the bedroom floor.
21 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER 21 *
Alice struggles out of the bedroom window. Bat in
hand. Becky lies in the flower bed.
BECKY
Mommy -- I hurt myself.
ALICE
Where?
Becky clutches her ankle in pain.
ALICE (CONT’D)
Try to stand.
Alice helps her up, but Becky’s ankle won’t hold her.
She starts to fall. Alice catches her, picks her up.
She has no choice but to discard the baseball bat.
Carrying her daughter, Alice crosses the back yard,
past a swing set, inflatable swimming pool, discarded
push bike etc. She kicks open the back gate and steps
out into the street to see --
22 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD 22 *
Chaos.
The neighbourhood is a warzone. Houses are burning.
Shots are fired. Cop cars race by, sirens blaring.
Becky watches in horror as people are chased by Undead,
dragged to the ground and ... Before she can see any
more, Alice covers her eyes.
Alice staggers into the street shell shocked - RIGHT
INTO THE PATH OF AN ONCOMING CAR!! The horn blares, *
the driver hits the brakes. Alice is frozen in shock.
The PRIUS slides to a halt just inches away from Alice *
and Becky. If it weren’t for the fast reflexes of the
driver, they’d both be dead.
The driver leans out- it’s MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ, “RAIN”
from RE1, but now dressed in as a very sexy, hippie *
post-grad student. Her fashionably distressed shirt is *
adorned with a multitude of badges and buttons - from *
“C.N.D.” to “Vegans Do It Better”, from “Smash the NRA” *
to “The Smurfs”. Greenpeace flyers are scattered *
across the back seat. *
12.
20 CONTINUED: 20
(CONTINUED)
RAIN
What the hell are you doing?!
ALICE
(still in shock)
I’m sorry ... I ...
(stares at the
chaos around her)
What’s going on?
RAIN
Get in.
Alice doesn’t move. Glances back at her house.
ALICE
My husband ... he’s still
inside.
RAIN
Get in the car. *
As if on cue, a HUGE HOARD of Undead run around the
corner.
RAIN (CONT’D)
Told you ...
Alice bundles Becky onboard the Prius and Rain hits the *
gas. An Undead grabs the backs of the car and is *
dragged down the street.
23 INT. PRIUS - CONTINUOUS 23 *
Alice glances in the side mirror as the Undead is
dislodged and rolls across the street. The impact
would kill a human, but of course the Undead just gets
back up and keeps running.
Rain floors the gas --
RAIN
Buckle up.
ALICE
What is all this?
RAIN
Your guess is good as mine. One
minute I’m coming back from *
class, the next ... *
ALICE
Why are those people doing this?
13.
22 CONTINUED: 22
(CONTINUED)
RAIN
I don’t think they’re people.
(Alice stares at
her)
Not any more.
BECKY
I’m scared Mommy.
ALICE
It’s going to be okay. *
As she calms her daughter, the car races through an *
intersection --
24 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD - INTERSECTION 24 *
BAMM!!! A MOVING TRUCK collides with the Prius at high *
speed. The car tumbles end over end, tearing itself *
apart.
25 INT. PRIUS - CONTINUOUS 25 *
As the truck slides to a halt on its roof, we see the
crumpled forms of Alice and Becky inside. Still alive.
ALICE
Are you hurt?
Becky doesn’t reply -- shocked. Alice locks eyes with
her. Talks to her as calmly as she can --
ALICE (CONT’D)
Baby ... baby, look at me ...
can you move?
26 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD - INTERSECTION 26 *
Alice kicks out the windshield of the up-ended car. *
Crawls out, pulling Becky with her. Once her daughter
is safe, she leans back in to help Rain.
ALICE’S P.O.V. --
She sees Rain - hanging upside down from her seat-belt.
Unconscious. Maybe dead.
BECKY (O.S.)
(scared)
Mommie!!!!
Nothing Alice can do for Rain now. Instead she goes to
help her daughter.
14.
23 CONTINUED: 23
(CONTINUED)
Becky stares at the chaos around her. This is the edge
of the housing estate - a multiple car pile-up lies at
the foot of a sign announcing that this is the gateway
to “SUNDOWN MEADOWS”. One home is burning out of
control, another has a crashed NEWS HELICOPTER embedded
in the garage - rotor blades still turning. *
Alice scoops up her daughter.
ALICE
Come on.
Across the road stands a large home, seemingly
untouched by the madness. Alice heads for it.
27 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME DAY. 27
Alice kicks open the door, Becky in her arms. The
place is seemingly empty. She heads for the stairs.
BECKY
What are we going to do?
ALICE
Don’t worry. We’re going to
find a safe place. We’re going
to stay out of the way and hide.
We’re going to wait for help.
Don’t worry baby. They’ll send
someone. Someone will come to
help us soon.
BECKY
What about Daddy?
ALICE
Daddy’s going to be okay. He’s
okay. We’ll see him soon.
28 INT. PRIUS DAY. 28 *
CLOSE ON RAIN --
Her eyes open - slow and painful - but not dead after
all.
RAIN
Damn it ...
RAIN’S P.O.V. --
The World is upside down. Through the remains of the
windshield she sees the pack of Undead race around the
corner. Dozens of them. They’ve caught up with her.
15.
26 CONTINUED: 26
(CONTINUED)
RAIN (CONT’D)
Oh shit!!
Rain struggles to be free of the seat-belt.
29 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - NURSERY DAY. 29
No sign of the baby or the family that once lived here.
Alice hurries Becky past the empty crib and slides open
the louvre doors of the closet.
ALICE
Inside ... quick.
30 EXT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 30
A handful of Undead break off from the pack and head
for the house. Back at the wrecked Prius we have no *
idea if Rain survived or not.
31 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 31
The Undead race into the house. One of them climbs the
stairs.
32 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - NURSERY - CLOSET 32
Alice and Becky hide in the closet. They listen to the
Undead rampaging through the house. Becky clings to
her mother.
Through the slats of the louvre doors they see an
Undead enter the room. Becky whimpers. Alice holds
her close. Puts her hand over Becky’s mouth.
The Undead looks around the room. Upends a table.
Children’s toys scatter across the floor. A TOY MONKEY
spins in place, clashing his cymbals together.
The Undead heads for the door. Alice heaves an
inaudible sigh of relief.
Then suddenly the Undead stops. Standing on the
threshold. He opens his mouth. It splits unnaturally
wide, and a hideous set of MANDIBLES slowly force their
way out. The Mandibles wave in the air - as if sensing
for something.
Becky’s eyes widen - horrified. She can’t help but cry
out. The Undead turns immediately.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
16.
28 CONTINUED: 28
(CONTINUED)
Watching the Undead come back into the room. Searching
for them. Alice leans into Becky. Whispers as quietly
as she can - her voice hidden by the noise of the
mechanical Monkey and his clashing cymbals.
ALICE
Listen to me baby, whatever
happens, you stay here.
Becky stares at her - terrified. Alice forces the
words out. The hardest thing a mother can do - leaving
her child --
ALICE (CONT’D)
I’ll come back for you. I
promise. I’ll come back ...
Alice covers her daughter in a blanket. But before she
can go --
BECKY
I love you Mommy.
Outside, the Undead is at the closet door. They can
almost feel his rank breath.
ALICE
(tears in her eyes)
I love you too ...
33 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - NURSERY - CONTINUOUS 33
The closet doors are thrown open, hitting the Undead in
the face. He reels back as Alice charges him, wailing
like a banshee. She BODY SLAMS the Undead, sending it
flying backwards. The Undead impacts with the crib,
smashing it into pieces.
Alice slams the closet doors closed. Behind her, the
Undead is already struggling to its feet, its Mandibles
thrashing madly.
Alice races for the door, the Undead in close pursuit.
34 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS 34
The Undead catches her at the top of the stairs. Alice
is knocked to the ground. She struggles away, kicking
at the Undead, even as it claws her. Alice fights her
way back to her feet. The Mandibles snapping wildly,
barely missing her face.
CLOSE ON --
Alice’s feet as they teeter on the edge of stairs, then
suddenly SLIP!
17.
32 CONTINUED: 32
(CONTINUED)
Alice and the Undead go crashing down. The Undead
SMASHES through the railing, splintering the wood.
Alice falls the length of the stairs.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
At the foot of the stairs. Bruised, winded, but still
alive. She looks up. Half way down the staircase, the
Undead is IMPALED on a broken wooden railing. It
struggles wildly, its Mandibles thrashing around, but
its not going anywhere.
Alice forces herself to her feet, turns and comes face
to face with --
TODD
Her husband. His once crisp white shirt is bloodied.
His complexion pale.
ALICE
Todd ...
Without warning Todd lunges. His infected face
splitting open to reveal WICKEDLY SHARP MANDIBLES.
Alice is too stunned to do anything.
As the mandibles CRUNCH into her face, we --
SMASH CUT
TO:
35 CLOSE ON ALICE’S EYE -- 35
As she awakens. The signature Resident Evil shot.
PULL BACK to REVEAL that she is lying naked on the
floor of an --
36 INT. INTERROGATION CELL 36
Alice’s body is curled in a foetal position. Lying on *
the cold plexiglass floor. The plexi is lit from below *
and it forms distinctive the shape of the UMBRELLA
LOGO.
Alice is their prisoner once again.
She sits up, shaking her head. What the hell was that?
A dream? A memory? A fantasy?
She looks around the spartan room. Hexagonal in shape
(like the Umbrella Logo) the highly polished steel
walls are over forty feet high. A smoked glass window
is set into one wall, thirty feet above her. No way to
reach it.
18.
34 CONTINUED: 34
(CONTINUED)
At floor level, a large steel door is set flush to the
wall. It doesn’t have hinges or even have a handle.
There’s no chance of escape.
ALICE
Where am I?
But no one answers.
Alice catches sight of her reflection in the polished
steel walls. She now has the same dark hair that she
had on the Arcadia.
Suddenly a panel on the wall lowers. Alice hears the
whir of unseen motors as a tray extends into the room.
On it sits a simple set of plain black underwear
bearing a discreet Umbrella Logo.
Alice takes the clothing and immediately the tray
withdraws back into the wall. Behind her a simple *
steel bed slides silently out of the wall. *
37 INT. INTERROGATION CELL - MOMENTS LATER 37
Alice has just finished dressing when the CELL LIGHTS
switch off. The cell is plunged into darkness. After
a moment, a strong light turns on behind the smoked
glass window. It illuminates three silhouetted
figures. These are Alice’s INTERROGATORS.
INTERROGATOR 1
Why did you turn against
Umbrella?
Alice doesn’t reply.
INTERROGATOR 2
Who do you work for?
Alice doesn’t reply.
INTERROGATOR 3
Where is Wesker?
Alice doesn’t reply.
The sudden sound of high pitched feedback fills the
room. It’s deafening. The feedback increases in
pitch, becoming unbearable.
Alice clutches her ears, trying to block it out.
But the sound just continues getting worse and worse.
Alice writhes on the floor, in intense pain. *

SMASH CUT

40 INT. INTERROGATION CELL - FOLLOWING DAY 40
Alice awakes - sleeping on the simple bed. *
The lights dim.
Her Interrogators appear.
Wait, they DON’T appear. The light behind the smoked
glass doesn’t go on as usual. *
No Interrogators.
No questions.
No high pitched feedback.
Instead, there is the slightest CLICK and the steel
door to the cell swings open a little.
Creepy.
41 INT. CORRIDOR 41
Alice pushes open the cell door and finds herself in an *
endless corridor. Made of milky glass lit from behind - *
it almost seems alive. The only sound is the soft HUM *
of an air filtration system. *
Creepy. *
Alice looks to the left - the corridor stretches to *
infinity. She looks to the right - an identical view. *
INT. BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS *
A high tech barracks - clearly a part of the same *
facility. An alarm sounds and Jill Valentine leaps *
into action. Around her, UMBRELLA TROOPERS grab their *
weapons. Jill punches up a surveillance image on a *
computer. She sees Alice in the corridor. *
VALENTINE *
She’s escaped!! *
21.
39 CONTINUED: 39
INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS *
Suddenly Alice hears a faint noise. She stops and *
listens. A distant sound, but getting closer - like *
giant’s footsteps.
In the distance, the lights of the corridor are *
switching off. Plunging it into pitch darkness. *
Alice runs.
CAMERA P.O.V. -- *
At the edge of the darkness. Catching up with Alice. *
ON ALICE --
The darkness is almost upon her. Up ahead she sees the *
end of the corridor - a door. She sprints for it. *
And just as the darkness engulfs her, she crashes
though the door and into --
45 EXT. BRANDENBURG GATE NIGHT. 45 *
The door slams behind her and Alice finds herself in *
BERLIN. The square in front of the Brandenburg gate is *
littered with burnt out cars, army trucks and dead *
bodies. The buildings riddled with bullet holes. *
Remnants of a battle which humanity lost. *
Alice stares at the door through which she came. But *
nothing emerges. She catches her breath and looks *
around. No sign of life, or of the Undead. *
It’s quiet, creepy and scary as hell. *
46 INT/EXT. GERMAN POLICE CAR NIGHT. 46 *
Alice spies a jacket and a pistol in a rack at the back *
of the car. She opens the door AND A DEAD BODY TUMBLES *
OUT!!! Alice jumps back, expecting the worst, but this *
is not an Undead. Gingerly, she reaches back into the *
car and takes the weapon. She also puts the jacket *
over her shoulders and pulls on a pair of boots. From *
the courtyard cobbles she takes a discarded SWORD. *
Up ahead, a PILLAR OF LIGHT suddenly appears at the *
heart of the courtyard. Alice walks cautiously towards *
it. The light appears to be coming through the cracks *
around the paving stones themselves. Alice leans in *
close to investigate, when suddenly -- *
THE GROUND BENEATH HER OPENS UP LIKE A TRAP DOOR, *
PLUNGING HER INTO -- *
22.
51 INT. UNDERGROUND SHAFT - CONTINUOUS 51 *
As Alice tumbles downwards, we see that the walls of *
the shaft are the same MILKY GLASS that we saw in the *
Umbrella Facility.
Alice hits a curved section of the shaft and starts to
slide, breaking her fall. Slowly she becomes aware of a *
light up ahead - filtering through the bars of a METAL
VENT.
CLOSE ON THE METAL VENT --
As Alice kicks it out and clambers through into --
52 OMITTED 52 *
53 OMITTED 53 *
54 EXT. SHIBUYA SCRAMBLE NIGHT. 54 *
The lights of Shibuya burn as bright as ever. Huge
jumbotron screens, neon lights, endless flashing
advertisements. Everything as it should be, except
there are NO PEOPLE.
The WALK/DON’T WALK signs flash for non-existent
pedestrians. The traffic lights change for non
existent cars and trucks.
Alice walks to the centre of the deserted SCRAMBLE.
She stands alone. Dwarfed by Tokyo, seemingly the last
woman on Earth. A stunning, but terrifying image.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
As something hits her cheek. She touches it. A drop
of water. It’s raining.
Suddenly the doors to every department store burst open
as one, and the Scramble is FILLED WITH PEOPLE. Cars
come around the corner. In an instant the streets are
choked with pedestrians and traffic. Five thousand
people and five hundred cars - all within a heartbeat.
Now the raindrops are coming thick and fast.
It seems as if Alice is the only one without an
Umbrella, until a striking J-POP GIRL walks silently
past her. Her outfit is soaking wet, but she seems
oblivious to the rain. Her eyes seem unfocussed and
distant. She stops at the very centre of the Scramble.
23.
(CONTINUED)
A BUSINESSMAN walks past Alice and catches eyes with
the J-Pop girl.
We are watching a replay of the action from the start
of RE: AFTERLIFE - only now Alice is somehow witnessing
it first-hand.
The J-Pop Girl lunges at the Businessman, dragging him
to the ground, tearing at his throat. The Scramble is
filled with sudden panic. People drop their Umbrellas
and flee. The BUSINESSMAN leaps to his feet. His eyes
are milky white. He bites into a passing KOGAL GIRL
and the panic spreads even faster. Suddenly Undead are *
everywhere. Alice is exposed by the fleeing crowd. *
J-Pop spots Alice. She raises her arm, points at Alice *
and unleashes an UNEARTHLY HOWL. Snaking MAJINI *
TENTACLES burst from her mouth. Flanked by Salaryman *
and Kogal, they make a terrifying trio. *
Alerted by J-Pop’s cry, all Undead eyes are on Alice. *
She’s alone and heavily outnumbered. *
Suddenly behind Alice, the front of the 109 building *
begins to SPLIT OPEN like a giant door!! *
Blinding white shafts from within. As the Undead *
charge, Alice has no option but to flee into the light. *
55 INT. CORRIDOR OF LIGHT - CONTINUOUS 55 *
This high-tech corridor is made of milky glass lit from *
behind. Similar to the one she had already *
encountered, but much taller and wider. *
Half way down the corridor, Alice is overtaken by J-Pop *
and is forced to turn and fight. *
The furious battle that follows, between Alice and a *
dozen Undead, is all played out in ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT. *
A breathtaking piece of choreography that will have the *
audience cheering. For the first time in the franchise, *
Alice fights with a blade and gun combined. *
As the last of the Undead fall, Alice turns to see a *
door at the far end of the corridor - a way out. *
BEHIND ALICE --
A horde of more Undead from Shibuya. More than she *
could possibly fight. Alice runs - the Undead right on *
her tail.
She makes it to the steel door, ducks inside and SLAMS
it in the faces of the Undead just in time!!

59 COMPLETE DARKNESS -- 59
For a moment we hear Alice’s breathing, and the muffled
sound of the Undead hammering on the door. Then
automated lights flicker on to reveal --
60 INT. UMBRELLA CONTROL ROOM NIGHT. 60 *
A vast control room. Its futuristic design looks *
almost like the bridge of a spaceship. A cluster of
huge monitors dominate the room. The Umbrella Logo is *
everywhere. *
Other than Alice, the room is deserted.
One wall is occupied by a large floor to ceiling
window. Alice walks to it and stares out -- but it is
pitch dark out there, giving no indication of where in
the World she might be.
Beside the window is a series of storage lockers.
Alice opens them to reveal an array of weaponry and
body armor.
ALICE
Pay-dirt ...
RAPID FIRE MONTAGE --
Of Alice as she selects pieces of webbing and body
armor. This combined with the black Umbrella underwear
makes for a unique, sexy and deadly outfit.
A brace of machine pistols and an over-under assault
rifle/grenade launcher combo completes the ensemble.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
As she walks to the opposite side of the room from the
window. She levels the grenade launcher. She’s going
to blast her way out of here.
Her finger tightens on the trigger.
ADA WONG (O.S.)
I wouldn’t do that if I were
you.
Alice spins to see a figure standing in a doorway - ADA
WONG - Chinese descent, signature red dress hugging a
refined silhouette, a pistol pointed straight at Alice.
The two women face off, guns levelled. They circle one
another - like two beautiful scorpions.
25.
(CONTINUED)
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
My name is ...
ALICE
(interrupting)
Ada Wong. Operative for the
Umbrella Corporation and one of
Albert Wesker’s top agents. I
know exactly who, and what, you
are.
(her finger
tightens on the
trigger)
The real question is why I
shouldn’t just cancel your
contract right now?
ADA WONG
I don’t work for Umbrella
anymore.
ALICE
And I’m supposed to just believe
that?
ADA WONG
Who do you think let you out of
that cell? Who do you think led *
you here? You wouldn’t have *
made it this far without me.
ALICE *
Why? *
Ada carefully lowers her gun. Places it on a table.
Alice keeps hers trained - taking no chances.
ADA WONG *
You have a benefactor. Someone
who no longer sees eye to eye *
with the Umbrella Corporation.
Someone who wants you out of *
here.
Ada punches some buttons on a computer keyboard. The *
monitors around the room come to life, revealing a *
familiar BLACK CLAD FIGURE, grinning like the Cheshire *
Cat -- *
ALICE *
Wesker ... *
WESKER *
How nice to see you again. *
ALICE *
I killed you. *

WESKER *
(casual) *
A clone. *
(smiles) *
You didn’t really think I’d put *
myself in harm’s way did you? *
ALICE *
Why do you want to help me? *
WESKER *
I have my reasons. Let’s just *
say, for the moment, your *
interests and mine are in *
alignment. You want out of here *
... and I want to help you. *
ALICE *
And where exactly is here? *
WESKER *
You are in the prime Umbrella *
Testing Facility ... the belly
of the beast.
ALICE
Explain Berlin ... Tokyo. *
WESKER *
Detailed recreations, nothing
more. They go on for a few city
blocks, that’s all.
ALICE
I was outside.
ADA WONG *
Were you? Saw the sky did you?
ALICE
It was night.
WESKER *
Stars? The moon?
Alice thinks for a moment.
ADA WONG *
Thought not.
Around the room, the monitors show city views of *
Berlin, Tokyo, New York, London and many others.
WESKER *
The testing floor is a mile
across. Three hundred feet
high. The ceiling black. It’s *
always night in there. *

ALICE
(sill unsure)
It was raining ...
ADA WONG
Sprinkler system - fitted to the
ceiling for climate control.
They can even make it snow if *
they want to. *
The enormity of this sinks in with Alice. *
ALICE
Why build such a place?
WESKER *
The Umbrella Corporation derived *
its primary income from the sale
of viral weaponry. Something
that’s impossible to test in the
real World. So they built this
place. Umbrella recreated the
centre of New York, simulated an
outbreak, recorded the whole
thing, then showed the results
to the Russians - and sold them
the virus. Then they simulated
an outbreak in Moscow ... and
sold it to the Americans. An
outbreak in Tokyo ...
ALICE
... they sell to the Chinese.
ADA WONG *
An outbreak in China ...
ALICE
... they sell to the Japanese.
WESKER *
Everyone had to have it. The
Umbrella Corporation built a new
arms race. Only this time it
was biological rather than
nuclear.
Alice glances around the control room - at the multiple *
images of cityscapes playing on the monitors.
WESKER (CONT’D) *
And this is where it all
happened. Umbrella’s greatest *
investment ... their greatest
creation. Like I said ... the
belly of the beast.

Alice levels her gun at the floor to ceiling window
once more.
ALICE
So why don’t we just get the
hell out of here?
Ada glances at her watch --
ADA WONG
Sun-up is in less than a minute. *
Why don’t you just see for
yourself.
EXTERIOR SHOT --
Of Alice through the glass. She lowers her gun and
stares out into the darkness.
ALICE’S P.O.V. --
For a moment she sees nothing but a dark void. Then
the first rays of sunlight illuminate the most
magnificent sight --
The clear icy blue peaks of a mountain range. But
something is wrong. For the mountains are inverted.
Instead of growing upwards towards the sky, they hang
upside down.
The sunlight intensifies. The sun’s rays filtering
THROUGH the inverted icy blue peaks.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
As she realizes the truth.
ALICE
Ice ...
61 EXT. UMBRELLA FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 61
We see Alice at the window. Shocked. Then THE CAMERA
PULLS BACK to reveal that the entire facility is DEEP
UNDERWATER. Far beneath the Arctic ice flows.
Only as we get more distant from the facility, do we
realize its truly vast scale. A huge steel construct
that sits on the seabed, connected to the underwater
cliffs of the mainland by a vast concrete bunker that
strangely bears the HAMMER AND SICKLE of the old
U.S.S.R.
29.
60 CONTINUED: (4) 60
62 INT. UMBRELLA CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 62
Alice turns away from the glass. Behind her we see the
sea bed - now faintly illuminated by the rising sun
filtering through the ice.
ALICE
Where exactly are we?
ADA WONG
The Straits of Kamchatka ...
Northern Russia.
WESKER *
The old Soviet Union built
submarine pens here in the
eighties ... to house their
Typhoon class subs. After the
cold war ended the Umbrella
Corporation took them over and
expanded them. Built the
testing floor.
ALICE
And how do we get out?
ADA WONG
(matter of fact)
We cross the test floor, through
the submarine pens, then take an
elevator to the surface.
ALICE
Just like that?
ADA WONG
(smiles)
No, not really.
ALICE
I didn’t think so.
ADA WONG
But don’t worry. We’re going to
have a little help ...
63 EXT. UMBRELLA FACILITY - UNDERWATER DAY. 63
The Camera PULLS AWAY from the vast underwater
facility, and rises up THROUGH the pack ice to reveal --
64 EXT. KAMCHATKA PENINSULAR - SNOW FIELD DAY. 64
A HELICOPTER shot of the vast snowfield. A blinding *
white expanse.
30.
(CONTINUED)
Staggeringly beautiful and deadly in equal measures.
And at the heart of this pristine snowscape, three tiny
red dots --
65 EXT. SPRYTES - CONTINUOUS 65 *
Three bright red Sprytes churn through the snow and *
ice. They grind to a halt at the foot of a steep
ridge. Out steps LUTHER WEST - last survivor from the
prison in Los Angeles (RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE). His
handsome African American face is framed by the fur
collar of his military camouflage coat. His breath
mists in the cold air.
LUTHER
Damn it’s cold!!! You know I’m
from California don’t you?
Beside Luther stands another figure, also in
Camouflage. It’s someone we haven’t seen before. Midthirties,
stern jawline, leader of the resistance
against Umbrella - LEON S. KENNEDY.
LEON
Let’s take a look.
66 BINOCULAR P.O.V. -- 66
A series of low concrete bunkers are clustered by the
cliffs. Far below is the gradually moving pack ice of
the Kamchatka Strait. The facility looks like what it
is - an old Soviet military installation - the surface
entrance to the submarine pens. It also looks
abandoned. Further off in the distance, locked in the *
icy bay are dozens of abandoned Russian warships. The *
mothballed Soviet fleet. It’s a ghostly, eerie sight. *
67 EXT. KAMCHATKA PENINSULAR - RIDGE - CONTINUOUS 67
Leon and Luther lie flat on the crest of the ridge.
Looking at the Soviet Facility below. A third man
joins them - SERGEI - he’s the technical specialist of
the group. Luther points something out - three huge
vents by the water’s edge.
LUTHER
There they are.
SERGEI
Intake vents for the submarine
pens.
LUTHER
Looks quiet.
Leon sweeps the abandoned facility one last time.

LEON
Then what are we waiting for ...
68 EXT. KAMCHATKA PENINSULAR - SNOW FIELD DAY. 68
The three Sprytes crest the ridge and head towards the *
Soviet facility.
69 TELESCOPIC SIGHT -- 69
We see the sights of a ROCKET LAUNCHER line up on the
lead Spryte. *
70 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 70
Suddenly a dozen UMBRELLA TROOPERS appear from
concealment. Fake concrete walls drop away to reveal a
huge arsenal of heavy weaponry. Rocket launchers, anti
tank guns, missile pods - enough to take out a small
army. Simultaneously they all OPEN FIRE.
The three Sprytes are blown apart in an instant. *
71 EXT. KAMCHATKA PENINSULAR - SNOW FIELD - LATER 71
A half dozen Umbrella Troopers approach the burnt out
wrecks of the Sprytes. To their surprise, the Sprytes *
are empty. Suddenly the bodies of the troopers
pirouette and twist in the air - then fall to the
ground. Multiple puncture marks leak crimson blood
onto the crisp white snow.
72 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 72
The remaining Umbrella Troopers manning the anti tank
guns and missile pods are also torn apart by the same
SILENT GUNFIRE. Their bodies fall to the ground. A
dozen men dead in a spilt second - and all without a
single sound.
73 EXT. KAMCHATKA PENINSULAR - RIDGE - CONTINUOUS 73
Leon lowers the sights of his SNIPER RIFLE. Beside him
are 6 other men - including Luther and Sergei. Each
one has the same rifle, equipped with a telescopic
sight and SUPPRESSOR to deaden the sound of the
gunfire. Amongst the group is BARRY BURTON. Mid
thirties, professional soldier, signature unlit cigar
clamped between his teeth. On his hip he wears a
customized .44 MAGNUM COLT ANACONDA.
Leon is the first to his feet --

74 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY DAY. 74
Leon and his team approach the low concrete structure
on foot.
LEON
Magnus check our out. Barry,
Luther take care of the vents.
Sergei ... you know what to do.
MAGNUS (tough Norwegian type, at home in the snow)
opens a metal roller door to reveal three Sprytes *
painted in Umbrella colors.
Sergei removes a metal hatch to reveal a computer port.
He plugs his laptop in and starts to work --
SERGEI
Running a bypass.
Leon hands him a note - a series of handwritten numbers
on it --
LEON
These are the access codes Ada
gave us.
SERGEI
You trust her?
Leon just smiles.
LEON
Just enter the numbers ...
75 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY - INTAKE VENTS - CONTINUOUS 75
Three large towers stand by the water’s edge. Each
contains a huge rotating fan - sucking air down into
the facility far below. Barry and Luther place
explosives at the base of each tower. Barry hooks them
up to a timer. Sets it for two hours. The time
immediately begins counting down -- 01:59:59 --
01:59:58 -- 01:59:57 --
BARRY
What if we take longer than two
hours?
LUTHER
Then I hope you’re good at
holding your breath.

73 CONTINUED: 73
76 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY - CONTINUOUS 76
Sergei unplugs his computer.
SERGEI
We’re in!!
To one side of the low concrete bunkers, the snow
begins to move - seemingly by itself. Huge SILO DOORS
open to reveal three deep shafts going straight down
into the ground. Each one is hundreds of feet deep.
The central shaft has four freight elevator platforms
attached to its walls.
Luther stares down into the depths --
LUTHER
Elevators ... I hate elevators.
INT. INTERROGATION CELL - CONTINUOUS *
Checking Alice’s empty cell is Jill Valentine (still in *
evil bad-ass mode) and a team of masked and heavily *
armed Umbrella Troopers. Jill is still wearing the *
HIGH TECH SCARAB on her chest -- which keeps her firmly *
under the control of the Umbrella Corporation. *
MASKED TROOPER *
The lock’s untouched. Someone *
must have let her out. *
VALENTINE *
(angry) *
That was my prisoner. I want *
her back! Track her. *
A masked FEMALE TROOPER consults a THERMAL TRACKING *
DEVICE. It reveals the feint outline of Alice’s bare *
footprints -- *
FEMALE TROOPER *
We have residual thermal *
readings. Looks like she’s 10 *
minutes ahead of us. *
77 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY - SILO SHAFT - ELEVATOR DAY. 77
Leon and the team ride one of the elevator platforms
down. It is large - built enough to carry vehicles and
equipment. They are pretty deep already - the bright
Arctic sky a distant circle of light far above.
34.

LEON
Everything down there is *
computer controlled, but there *
will be a military presence. We *
should expect resistance, and *
plenty of it. What time do you *
have?
LUTHER
01:55:00 in three, two, one ...
mark.
The team synchronize their watches. Each team member
wears an identical COUNTDOWN WATCH.
BARRY
Why don’t we just trigger the
explosives remotely?
SERGEI
Can’t risk them jamming the
signal.
At the bottom of the silo, the elevator enters a much
smaller tube - just big enough for the elevator
platform. As they are swallowed by the darkness --
LEON
Into the rabbit hole ...
78 INT. UMBRELLA CONTROL ROOM 78
Ada checks her COUNTDOWN WATCH - identical to the ones
worn by the others. It has just activated and is
ticking down -- 01:54:01 -- 01:54:00 -- 01:53:59 --
ADA WONG
They’re in ...
Ada produces a small TABLET COMPUTER. A detailed
WIREFRAME shows the layout of the facility, their
position in it and their planned escape route.
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
The strike team has secured the *
surface entrance here. They’ll
rendezvous with us halfway
across the test floor and escort

FLASHBACK --
As Luther wanders an abandoned Sunset Boulevard. A
helicopter touches down beside him. Landing right in
the middle of the Sunset Strip. Onboard, he meets Leon
and talks with him.
ADA WONG (V.O.) (CONT’D)
He saw them capture you at the
ship -- that’s how we knew
Umbrella had you.
We see the end of RE4 - Luther watching from the shore
as the Umbrella V-22s attack the Arcadia. Through
binoculars he witnesses Alice being hauled from the
water. On the deck, Jill Valentine stands over Alice’s
unconscious body.
VALENTINE
They want the prisoner for *
interrogation. I’ll deliver her

81 INT. UMBRELLA FACILITY - BASE OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 81
A vast vaulted stone chamber carved out of the living *
rock. It is dominated by huge CYRILLIC LETTERING. A *
squad of heavily armed UMBRELLA TROOPS enter at speed -- *
UMBRELLA TROOPER 1 *
Unauthorized movement of *
Elevator 2! *
UMBRELLA CAPTAIN *
Contact topside. Find out what *
the hell’s going on up there. *
UMBRELLA TROOPER 1 *

The Umbrella troops take aim at Elevator Shaft 2. They *
can hear the elevator platform descending. Getting *
closer. Fingers tighten on triggers. *
UMBRELLA CAPTAIN (CONT’D) *
Mark your targets. Fire at *

The giant elevator platform enters through the roof of *
the chamber. There is no one on it. *
UMBRELLA TROOPER 1 *
It’s empty sir. *
The air goes out of the situation. *
But as the elevator platform locks into place, Leon and *
his team suddenly appear. THEY HAD BEEN LYING FLAT ON *
THE FLOOR AT THE BACK OF THE PLATFORM. Only visible at *
the last second. *
Leon flings a JUMPING JACK MINE at the troopers. It *
detonates silently and a split second later the *
Umbrella Captain and his squad hit the ground dead. *
Taken out in a storm of lethal spiked ball bearings. *

83 EXT. NEW YORK - TIMES SQUARE NIGHT. 83 *
Alice looks around the abandoned war zone that was once *
Times Square. Another battle for survival that ended *
badly. She stares up at the black, starless void that *
is the “night sky”. The true reality of this place *
sinking in. *
ALICE *
New York ... *

87 INT. UMBRELLA FACILITY - SUBMARINE PENS - CONTINUOUS 87 *
A long concrete corridor leads from the bottom of the *
elevator shafts to the submarine pens. This part of
the facility is the original Soviet construction - all
reinforced concrete and dim overhead lights. Its scale
however is breathtaking. The submarine pens are big
enough to house a half dozen TYPHOON CLASS nuclear
submarines - the biggest subs ever built. Most of the
bays are empty, but two Typhoons remain, now
resplendent in their black and red Umbrella colors.
Two UMBRELLA TROOPERS mount a machine gun post atop one *
of the submarine conning towers. Suddenly Leon appears *
behind them, dispatching both with ruthless, silent *
precision. Far above, on a GANTRY CRANE, Magnus takes *
out another two UMBRELLA GUARDS. Leon signals to the *
rest of the team, who double time it across the *
submarine pens. Luther looks up at the subs in awe -- *

Damn!! That’s some hardware ...
SERGEI
Typhoon Class. Biggest nuclear
subs the Soviets ever built.
Umbrella used them to secretly *
transport Bio-Weapons all over
the globe.
LUTHER
How come you know so much about
Umbrella?
SERGEI
(matter of fact)
Used to work for them. For a
boy from Murmansk it was a good
job. Now I like to consider it
... a youthful indiscretion.
Barry claps him on the back - almost sends Sergei
flying.
BARRY
Well, you’re on the right side
now.
SERGEI
(smiles)
So it would appear.
ANGLE ON LEON as he rejoins the group -- *

We have less than ninety
minutes!

92 INT. TEST FLOOR - NEW YORK - STREET DAY. 92 *
Alice and Ada make their way down an empty street *
littered with abandoned vehicles. *
ALICE
When do I see Luther?
ADA WONG
The strike team will rendezvous *
with us in the next environment. *
But until then, we’re on our
own.
ALICE
(to herself)
Of course ... *
SUDDENLY A FIGURE ERUPTS FROM BEHIND AN ABANDONED *
POLICE CAR!! *
An UNDEAD grabs Alice, and the two tumble to the *
ground. Alice struggles with the filthy Undead,
finally throwing it off. Alice draws and prepares to
fire --
ALICE’S P.O.V. --
The Undead gets to its feet and is revealed to be a
filthy version of RAIN (Michelle Rodriguez) - dressed
in what was once an elegant, sophisticated, sexy dress. *
For a moment, Alice is stunned. Then Rain bares her
broken teeth, howls and lunges.
Almost on instinct, Alice FIRES. And Rain falls back
dead.

87 CONTINUED: 87
(CONTINUED)
Ada runs over --
ADA WONG
What happened?!
Still shocked, Alice looks down at Rain’s body --
ALICE
I know her. Her name was Rain
... Rain Ocampo. But how can
she be here? She died years
ago.
ADA WONG
You’re sure of that?
ALICE
I should be. I killed her.
ADA WONG
Not her - just someone that
looked like her.
(off Alice’s look)
How do you think Umbrella
populates these test scenarios? *
Hundreds of people dead each
time they run a simulation.
Pretty hard to find volunteers.
ALICE
(putting the pieces
together)
Clones ...
ADA WONG
That’s right. Umbrella has *
fifty standard models. They *
take them out of the deep
freeze, and imprint them with
basic memories. Just enough to
ensure a correct emotional
response to the threat of the
Biohazard.
Ada studies Rain’s dead face.
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
One time she’s a tourist in
Beijing, the next a business *
woman in New York, the next ... *
Alice interrupts --
ALICE
... a soldier working for
Umbrella.
(the truth sinks
in)

(CONTINUED)
Everyone I met in The Hive.
They were all clones.
ADA WONG
Of course. What could be
better? The perfect soldier --
limitless in number, no
questions asked and loyalty
guaranteed ...
93 INT. UMBRELLA CONTROL ROOM 93
Valentine and her troops have made it to the Control
Room. One of the Troopers slides their helmet off to
reveal another clone of Rain --
RAIN
No sign of them.
VALENTINE
Check the surveillance tapes.
Another Trooper removes his helmet to reveal a familiar
face - ONE - the African American team leader from the
original RESIDENT EVIL - the one that was diced in the
laser corridor.
ONE
On it.
One rewinds the surveillance footage until it shows
Alice and Ada Wong in the control room.
ONE (CONT’D)
She was here ... and she had
help.
RAIN
That’s not all.
Rain points to another screen. On it we see Leon and
his team exiting the Submarine Pens.
RAIN (CONT’D)
Intruders. Just leaving the
submarine pens. They’re headed
for the test floor.
VALENTINE
They’re obviously here to help
our prisoner escape. Kaplan!
KAPLAN
Yes Ma’am.
Another Umbrella Trooper is revealed. It’s KAPLAN -
the com-tech specialist - also from RESIDENT EVIL 1 -
also someone we had thought dead.
42.
92 CONTINUED: (2) 92
ALICE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
VALENTINE
Arrange a little welcome party
for our guests.
KAPLAN
Very good Ma’am.
As Kaplan crosses to a computer terminal, he passes the
MEDIC - the one that was beheaded by the lasers in
RESIDENT EVIL 1 - the gang’s all here. Shock registers
with the franchise fans as they finally realize that
behind the anonymous faceplate of every Umbrella
Trooper in the last 3 sequels - was actually someone
they knew.
94 INT. TEST FLOOR - FACADE 94
We are behind one of the false buildings fronts on the
Test Floor. It several floors high. A spiderweb of *
high tech scaffolding holds it all in place.
THE CAMERA TRACKS from behind the facade and THROUGH
the wall to reveal --
95 EXT. “MOSCOW” - RED SQUARE NIGHT. 95
The Square is deserted. No sign of life, but also no
sign of the Undead. A creepy, icy mist hangs low to *
the ground. Leon and his strike team enter through *
Resurrection Gate and make their way on foot across the
Square. Luther checks his countdown watch --
LUTHER
One hour left. We’re behind
schedule.
BARRY
In a hurry to see your lady
friend?
LEON
We’ll meet them in the next
environment.
96 INT. UMBRELLA CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 96
Valentine and Kaplan watch Leon’s progress via multiple
concealed surveillance cameras mounted around and above
the “Moscow” Test Grid. The cameras also have sound --
LEON (ON CAMERA)
We’ll meet them in the next
environment.

93 CONTINUED: 93

VALENTINE
Guess we know where to find our
prisoner now. Kaplan ...
KAPLAN
Running Moscow Test Scenario.
As Valentine looks on, Kaplan finishes typing. The
screen in front of him flashes -- MOSCOW SCENARIO 12B
ACTIVATED. We see the scrolling details of an army of
LAS PLAGAS UNDEAD and various hideous creatures. *
KAPLAN (CONT’D)
Welcome Party has been arranged.
VALENTINE
Good. Now let’s move out. We
have a fugitive to run down.
And a traitor to kill.
97 EXT. “MOSCOW” - RED SQUARE NIGHT. 97
The sound of moving vehicles brings Leon and his team
to a halt.
LEON
Defensive positions.
At the other side of the Square, six MOTORBIKES skid to
a halt.
CLOSE ON THE RIDERS --
Their skin is cold and dead, but their eyes burn with a
fiery red glow. More victims of the Las Plagas virus.
The Riders gun their engines threateningly. One even
starts a CHAINSAW, and begins scraping it, sparking
across the ground.
ANGLE ON BARRY -- *
BARRY *
What the hell are those thing? *
LUTHER *
I don’t know about you. But *
they are not giving me a warm *
and fuzzy feeling inside. *
SERGEI *
They’re infected by the Las *
Plagas virus. Depending on the *
strength of the infection, the *
subject retains motor skills and *
some degree of intelligence. *

It can also develop unnatural *
strength and speed. *
BARRY *
Great ... *
More vehicles enter the square. FLAT BED TRUCKS and *
PICK-UPS mounted with HEAVY MACHINE GUNS and ROCKET
LAUNCHERS. All dressed in tattered Russian military *
uniforms. It’s like an UNDEAD ARMY. Their eyes all *
blaze with the distinctive Las Plagas fiery red glow.
BARRY (CONT’D) *
And it gets better ... *
One of the Undead RACKS BACK the slide on a giant
MACHINE GUN.
LEON
Fallback ... Fallback!!!
98 EXT. NEW YORK - STREET 98 *
Alice and Ada walk down a deserted street. In the *
distance, two figures approach them. Alice makes to *
draw her gun. *
ADA WONG *
They’re okay. *
ALICE *
You know them? *
Ada waves - and one of the figures waves back. As Ada *
and Alice drawn closer, the truth becomes clear. Alice *
and Ada are approaching a GIANT FLAWLESS MIRROR. It *
runs across the centre of the street - reflecting the *
cars, the buildings and Alice and Ada themselves. *
ADA WONG *
The edges of the test *
environments are all like this *
... Gives the illusion of *
depth. *
Ada waves her hand over the glass and an illuminated *
keypad appears. *
ADA WONG (CONT’D) *
Most scenarios are run at the *
centre of an environment. The *
test subjects may glimpse this *
from a distance, but rarely get *
a chance to reach the edges. *
She keys in a number and a MIRRORED DOOR appears in the *
glass. *

After you. *
Alice steps forward -- *
ALICE *
Through the looking glass ... *
They step through into --
99 EXT. THE DOME DAY. 99 *
A large steel wall rises in front of them. Ada begins *
to climb a set of stairs. *
ADA WONG *
This way. *
Alice stops in surprise. Far above, Alice sees a blue *
sky. *
ALICE
It’s day.
ADA WONG
It’s a sky dome. It’s just *
paint. *
ALICE’S P.O.V. --
Now she sees through the illusion. It’s a vast domed *
ceiling, painted with unmoving clouds. *
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
Doesn’t hold up too good if you
stare at it for long.
ALICE
How did people believe it?
ADA WONG
When they were running a
simulation, trust me, no one had
time to look at the clouds.

98 CONTINUED: 98

(CONTINUED)
Come on ... this is where we
rendezvous with the others.
Alice and Ada reach the top of the stairs and emerge *
into --
100 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD DAY. 100 *
A multiple car pile-up lies at the foot of a sign *
announcing that this is the gateway to “SUNDOWN
MEADOWS”. One home is burnt out completely, another
has a crashed NEWS HELICOPTER embedded in the garage.
Alice and Ada don’t recognize it, but of course, we
have been here before. A crashed Prius lies on its *
roof to further jog our memories.
Alice and Ada cross the road. There is no sign of
life.
ADA WONG
Whatever happened here, looks
like we missed it. *
101 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - NURSERY DAY. 101
Through the upstairs window we see Alice and Ada
walking in the street below.
SUDDENLY, SOMETHING MOVES IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA!!
102 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD - CONTINUOUS 102 *
ALICE
The house behind us. There’s
someone moving. Upstairs
window.
Ada casually glances to her side. Checks out the large
suburban home. We recognize it from before - this is
where Alice and Becky hid.
ADA WONG
I don’t see anything.
103 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - LIVING ROOM DAY. 103
Alice pushes open the unlocked door. The place is a
mess. She sees the body of the Undead impaled on what
remains of the staircase. Ada consults her countdown
watch. Less than 50 minutes remaining --
ADA WONG
We don’t have time for this.
47.
99 CONTINUED: 99
ADA WONG (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
But something has caught Alice’s eye.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
As we see the shock register.
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
What is it?
And now Ada sees it as well. The body of Alice. Lying
dead on the floor. Her face ripped apart by mandibles,
but still recognizable.
ALICE
They used clones of me ...
ADA WONG
You were one of the twenty basic
models.
ALICE
Basic models ...
Suddenly a noise from upstairs. Alice draws her gun.
ADA WONG
Alice, don’t ...
But she’s already climbing the stairs.
104 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - STAIRCASE 104
Alice pauses at the top of the stairs. The noise
again. Movement. Coming from --
105 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - NURSERY 105
Alice pushes open the door to the nursery. No sign of
the baby or the family that once lived here. This is
where the first Alice had hidden with Becky. Alice
walks past the broken crib.
ANGLE ON ALICE --
Through the louvre doors of the closet. Somebody/
something is watching her from within.
Slowly Alice makes her way to the closet. Puts her
hand on the doors, and slowly slides them aside to
reveal --
TODD!!! His mandibles already bursting forth. He
takes Alice down as they both CRASH to the ground.
Alice struggles with the Undead Todd, his mandibles
snapping right above her face.
48.
103 CONTINUED: 103
(CONTINUED)
Twisting to one side, Alice uses Todd’s body weight and
aggression against him. She FLIPS him over and he
CRASHES into a dresser, splintering it into a hundred
pieces.
Todd is back on his feet, charging, but Alice already
has her gun levelled.
106 INT. LARGE SUBURBAN HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 106
Ada Wong hears a shot. Moves to the foot of the
stairs.
ADA WONG
Alice?!
Alice appears at the head of the staircase.
ALICE
I’m fine.
SUDDENLY SOMETHING BURSTS OUT AT ALICE!!!
Emerging from its hiding place on the upstairs landing.
Alice is taken completely by surprise as something
leaps at her --
BECKY
Mommy!!! You came back!!
It’s Becky -- Alice’s “daughter”. She is crying.
Tears of joy.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I hid ... just like you told me.
I did good didn’t I?
Alice is speechless. But Becky doesn’t seem to notice.
She’s just so happy to have her “mother” back.
BECKY (CONT’D)
You came back!! I knew you
would. I knew it.
From her vantage point at the top of the stairs, it’s
clear she can’t see the body of her real mother, lying
just 30 feet away.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I love you! I love you so much
...
Alice sinks to the ground in shock. She sits at the
top of the stairs cradling the child in her arms.
SMASH CUT

107 INT. “MOSCOW” - GUM DEPARTMENT STORE NIGHT. 107 *
We join Leon and the others mid-battle. They have
taken shelter inside the famous Red Square landmark. *
Outside is a whole ARMY of Las Plagas Undead, motorized *
and on foot. Many of the Undead are heavily armed.
They advance like a wall of rotting flesh, eyes ablaze,
firing as they come. Unstoppable.
BARRY
They can’t shoot for shit!!!
Gunfire explodes around them.
LUTHER
Yeah, but there’s plenty of
them!!!
Luther unleashes a stream of machine gun fire. *
ANGLE ON THE UNDEAD IN RED SQUARE --
Many of them are hit, but they just keep on coming.
ANGLE ON LUTHER --
LUTHER (CONT’D)
And they don’t go down easy ...
108 EXT. RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 108
On the back of a flat bed truck an Undead levels a
ROCKET LAUNCHER right at the department store. He *
fires!!
109 INT. GUM DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS 109 *
Leon sees it coming.
LEON
RPG!!!! Down!!!
The RPG explodes, blasting a hole in the wall.
Luther is the first to recover. Undead are pouring in
through the gap. He takes the first wave out with a
mixture of martial arts and gunfire. Like a spinning
wheel of destruction, everywhere he kicks or shoots,
things die.
He clicks dry, just as an Undead leaps at him!
Leon BLASTS it out of the air. He consults his
countdown watch and turns to Sergei, who’s pouring over
his laptop in the midst of the chaos.

LEON (CONT’D)
We should be at the rendezvous
already! Find us a way out of

Sergei shrugs. What can you do?
ANGLE ON SERGEI’S COMPUTER --

110 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD DAY. 110 *
Ada checks her watch. For the first time, we see her
nervous. Valuable minutes are melting away.
ADA WONG
They should be here. *
BECKY
Mommy ...
We realize she is riding on Alice’s shoulders.
BECKY (CONT’D)
I thought I saw Daddy. Back
there ... in that house. I
thought he was one of those ...
(can hardly get the
words out)
... those things.
Alice, hearing the anguish in Becky’s voice, tries her
best to be reassuring --
ALICE
No. I’m sure you were mistaken.
I’m sure he’s okay.
Becky thinks for a moment --
BECKY
So maybe he’s back at our house.
Waiting for us?
ALICE
(reassuring) *
I’m sure he is. *

111 INT. MOSCOW - GUM DEPARTMENT STORE 111 *
We are thrown headlong back into white hot battle!! *
ANGLE ON SERGEI --
Working diligently on his computer as all hell breaks
loose around him. Leon, Luther and Barry shooting both *
ways, trying to stem the tide of the attack. Smoking
hot, spent cartridges rain down on Sergei’s laptop. He
glances up at Luther --
SERGEI
Do you mind?
He gets back to the schematics - trying to find a
potential escape route.
SERGEI (CONT’D)
Trying to work here ... *
112 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME DAY. 112 *
Through the living room window we see Alice, Ada and
Becky on the street outside. Becky now walks alongside *
Alice, holding her hand. We recognize the place as
Alice, Becky and Todd’s home from the start of the
movie.
113 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 113 *
Alice is about to walk straight past her “home”, when *
Becky suddenly bolts towards the house. She is gone *
before Alice can grab her. *
BECKY
Come on silly!! *
ALICE *
Wait!! *
BECKY *
We have to find Daddy! *
Becky runs past a swing-set and a discarded pink *
bicycle and disappears into the house. Alice heads off *
in pursuit when Ada grabs her arm. *

114 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME DAY. 114 *
Alice steps across the threshold. Ada follows. In the *
depths of the house, Becky calls for her father -- *
BECKY (O.S.) *
Dad!!! Daddy!!! Daddy!! *
ANGLE ON ALICE --
As she sees blood splashed on the floor and walls.
Becky appears. She’s visibly upset -- *
BECKY (CONT’D) *
He’s not here ... *
ADA WONG
(curt and
impatient)
Good. So let’s go! *
Alice shoots her a look. Worried about what else she
may say. Alice takes Becky in her arms. *
ALICE
(calm and
comforting)
You tried. You did your best.
Your daddy would be proud of
you. Now we’ll move on. It’s
for the best. I’m sure he’s on
the road ... we’ll catch up with
him.
Becky looks her “mother” in the eye”.
BECKY
You won’t leave me will you?
Like before? You won’t leave me
alone again.
ALICE
I won’t leave you.
BECKY
You promise.

113 CONTINUED: 113

ALICE
I promise.
Becky seems reassured. But emotionally, Alice is
getting herself in deep. Becky looks around --
BECKY
Are we coming back?
ALICE
No.
BECKY
I need to take some things.
Alice is aware of a stressed Ada, checking her watch.
ALICE
Just hurry. And stay where I
can see you.
ANGLE ON A SIDE TABLE --
Crammed with framed pictures of Becky, Todd and Alice.
At home, in the back yard, on holiday, on the beach,
clowning around. A happy family.
ANGLE ON ALICE --
Looking at all the images. Taking in the picture
perfect life that she never lived.
ADA WONG
None of this is real.
Alice looks up. Watches Becky hurriedly stuffing
things into a DORA backpack.
ALICE
It is to her.
ADA WONG
I know. That’s the point.
Ada watches Alice watching Becky. She can see the
developing attachment.
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
She’s not your daughter. She’s
not even a real person.
All these feelings she has for
you. They were imprinted.
They’re not real. A day ago she *
was a blank slate. She didn’t
even know who you were.
Ada lets her words sink in, then after a beat --

BECKY (O.S.)
Ready!
A smiling Becky is ready to go. Dora backpack and all. *
BECKY (CONT’D) *
I was fast, wasn’t I?
Alice tousles her hair.
ALICE
Yes you were.
115 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME DAY. 115 *
Alice, Becky and Ada step into the front yard. Waiting
for them, standing on the manicured grass are Jill
Valentine and her team. Rain sits on the swing-set, MP-
5 machine gun in hand.
VALENTINE
Welcome home. Nice place you
have.
She picks up a fallen pink bicycle. Stands it up
straight.
VALENTINE (CONT’D)
Now ... surrender or die.
ALICE
There’s a child here.
RAIN
Your problem ...
She racks back the MP-5, ready to fire.
RAIN (CONT’D)

All heart. You haven’t changed.

So what’s it to be?
Alice and Ada exchange the briefest of looks.
VALENTINE’S P.O.V. --
Alice walks in front of Ada, blocking her for a splitsecond.
When Alice clears, Ada already has her guns
out. She fires!! The Medic and another Umbrella
Trooper are picked off their feet with the impact.
As Valentine and the others dive for cover, Alice grabs
Becky and runs back inside.
116 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 116 *
Alice pulls Becky under cover.
BECKY
Mommy! What are you doing?!
Alice looks at Becky. Two guns in hand.
ALICE
Mommy stuff ...
She turns and fires, letting rip with both guns.
117 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 117 *
Alice’s bullets riddle a parked HONDA CIVIC. One finds
the gas tank and the car EXPLODES, spinning into the
air. Suburbia is being torn apart!!
ANGLE ON VALENTINE --
As the Honda Civic crashes down behind her.
VALENTINE
Suppressing Fire!!!
One and Rain have finished assembling a RAILGUN. An
electrical powered weapon, it magnetically fires solid
steel darts at a speed of 15,000 feet per second - five
times the velocity of a bullet from an M16.
ONE
Yes Ma’am!!
One let’s loose.

Ada and Alice dive for cover as the house is literally
TORN APART around them. The walls and the ceiling are
DISINTEGRATING before their eyes.
HYPER SLOW MOTION -- Reveals dozens of solid STEEL
DARTS tearing through the house, destroying everything
in their path. Missing our heros by inches.
119 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 119 *
The Railgun stops firing.
ONE

Rain is already on it. She swaps out one magazine.
Has another ready to go.
RAIN
Breach clear!!
120 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 120 *
A moment of calm. Pieces of rubble and plaster fall
all around. Broken light fittings swing wildly.
ADA WONG
You can’t stay here.
She hands Alice her small tablet computer.
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
This will show you the way out.
I’ll hold them back as long as I
can. I’ll meet you at the
elevator.
Alice and Ada share a look. Both know this is highly
unlikely.
ALICE
Thank you.
ADA WONG

Alice ... take this.
She holds her signature HOOK GUN out to Alice -- *
ADA WONG (CONT’D)
Might come in handy.

121 EXT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME 121 *
Rain slams another magazine into the Railgun.
RAIN
Set!
One opens fire again. Within a second, the house is
punctured with another hundred major impacts. They’re
turning it into swiss cheese!!
KAPLAN
We’ve got movement! Behind the
house. Two targets.
Ignoring the bullets that fly all around, Valentine
marches over to Kaplan. On his portable computer he
pulls up a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA P.O.V.
VALENTINE
Identify.
Kaplan ZOOMS IN the surveillance camera. Valentine
sees Alice and Becky - running away from the house.
VALENTINE (CONT’D)
Alice!
She looks up at the house. Knows it is just Ada in
there. Valentine turns to Rain --
VALENTINE (CONT’D)
Take this bitch out.
122 INT. ICONIC SUBURBAN HOME - CONTINUOUS 122 *
Ada takes out a couple of Troopers that are trying to
flank the house. She’s an awesome shot. She reloads

Behind Becky and Alice, a giant fireball hits the *
ceiling of the dome and rolls across the fake “sky”. *
ALICE *
They’ll be coming! We have to *
hurry. *
As Alice urges Becky on, she casually checks beneath *
her clothing. ALICE HAS A GAPING WOUND IN HER LEFT *
SIDE!! Wincing in pain, but making sure Becky sees *
nothing, Alice presses her hand against the wound, *
trying to staunch the flow of blood. *
ANGLE ON BECKY AND ALICE --
As they run down a side street, SOMEONE steps in front *
of CAMERA -- they are being followed!!
125 INT. “MOSCOW” - SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM 125 *
The illusion of the platform stretching into infinity
is suddenly broken as a GLASS DOOR slides open. This
is the edge of another test environment. Alice and
Becky step out from behind the flawless mirror.
BECKY
(shocked)
Where are we?
SUDDENLY, sensing movement behind them, Alice turns,
GUN IN HAND, to see RAIN!! Alice prepares to fire when
Becky intervenes --
BECKY (CONT’D)
Wait!! She helped us! Don’t
you remember?
Sure enough, this is the post-grad student clone of *
Rain. The one that had helped Becky and her Mom *
escape. Alice lowers her gun. *
RAIN
You two made it!
She hugs Alice and Becky.
RAIN (CONT’D)
I’m so happy there’s someone
else left alive.
Alice untangles herself from the awkward hug. Rain
looks around, amazed --

RAIN (CONT’D)
What is this place?
In the distance, Alice hears the noise of GUNFIRE. The
battle raging above in Red Square.
ALICE *
You know how to use this? *
Alice holds out one of her guns to Rain. Rain looks at *
it in disgust. *
RAIN *
I campaigned for gun control. *
Alice wraps her arms around Rain. Forcing the gun into *
Rain’s hand. *
RAIN (CONT’D) *
I marched against the NRA!! *
Alice places her hands over Rain’s hands. Forcing her *
to point the gun. *
ALICE
It’s just like a computer ...
Alice’s face is right besides Rain’s. Cheek to cheek.
Both women staring down the gun sights.
ALICE (CONT’D)
... point and click.
In the distance, a section of tiled wall explodes. *
ALICE (CONT’D)
Congratulations ... you’re now
officially a bad ass.
Rain looks at the smoking gun in her hand. Despite *
herself, we can see that she enjoyed that - just a *
little bit. Far above, the sound of battle *
intensifies. The noise of gunfire echoing around the
abandoned subway.
RAIN
What the hell is going on here?
ALICE
I’ll explain everything when I
get back.
(nods to Becky)
But right now I need you to keep
her safe.
60.
125 CONTINUED: 125
(CONTINUED)
BECKY
(shocked)
You’re going? You said you
wouldn’t leave!
ALICE
I’m going to be right back.
BECKY
You promised!!!
Alice kneels down beside Becky. Takes her in her arms.
ALICE
(softly)
Listen to me. You can trust me.
You do trust me, don’t you?
Becky nods.
ALICE (CONT’D)
What I say is true. I will be
back for you.
Becky is on the verge of tears, but holds them back.
She’s one brave little girl.
ALICE (CONT’D)
Okay?
BECKY
Okay.
Alice gets up. Makes to leave --
BECKY (CONT’D)
I love you.
For a moment it just hangs out there. Alice doesn’t
know how to react. She looks at Becky. The brave
little girl holding back the tears. Desperate for
reassurance.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
ALICE
I love you too.
Alice turns and goes. With Alice as she walks away.
We see the conflict play out on her face.
ANGLE ON BECKY --
Watching her “Mother” leave.
61.
125 CONTINUED: (2) 125
(CONTINUED)
RAIN
She’ll be back, don’t worry.
Come on. Let’s find some place
to hide.
Becky nods. Looks up at Rain --
BECKY
I met your sister.
RAIN
(confused)
What?
BECKY
She’s not very nice.
126 INT. MOSCOW - GUM DEPARTMENT STORE 126 *
The battle has only intensified. Leon checks his
countdown watch -- only 33 minutes to go. He dodges
bullets and flying debris to make it to Sergei - still
crouched over his laptop.
LEON
You have to find a way around *
them!! *
Sergei pours over the schematics of the Umbrella Test *
Floor -- *
SERGEI
Almost there ... *
Suddenly the gunfire stops. Strangely, the sudden
silence is even more unnerving than the noise of
battle.
LEON
Now what?
BARRY
Maybe they’re giving up?
Leon just stares at Barry.
127 EXT. RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 127
The wall of Undead parts to reveal --
A LICKER appears from behind a burning car. It’s long
tongue snakes out, sensing the air.
62.
125 CONTINUED: (3) 125
128 INT. GUM DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS 128 *
BARRY
Doesn’t look so bad.
129 EXT. RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 129
The Licker stretches its mouth wide, revealing rows of
razor sharp teeth, like a shark. The Licker calls out
to the night “sky”. Its voice a weird inhuman RATTLE.
Suddenly the car behind the Licker is CRUSHED by a
giant claw. PAN UP from the claw to reveal an UBERLICKER
- identical to the original creature, but TEN
TIMES THE SIZE!! This thing is as big as a BATTLE
TANK!!
130 INT. GUM DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS 130 *
Leon glances at Barry. Barry shrugs.
BARRY
Can’t be right all the time ... *
Suddenly Sergei slams his computer shut. *
SERGEI *
Got it!! This way!! *
131 EXT. STREET BEHIND THE GUM DEPARTMENT STORE 131 *
A quiet backstreet. A moment of still calm - broken *
when a chair comes arcing through the department store *
window, smashing the glass out. Leon, Luther, Barry *
and Sergei follow close behind. *
SERGEI *
This way ... *
LEON
Move, move, move!!! *
SERGEI
We can work our way around the *
perimeter and ... *
SERGEI IS CUT SHORT AS SUDDENLY A GIANT SERRATED TONGUE *
WRAPS AROUND HIM!! *
Screaming, Sergei is lifted upwards. Hanging directly *
above them is an UBER LICKER. Around it are a dozen *
COCOONED BODIES. These people are still alive - *
writhing within the transparent cocoons!! The Uber *
Licker rips Sergei clean in half. *
63.
(CONTINUED)
Leon and the others open fire, but their bullets do
little damage. The Uber Licker, leaps down, landing in *
the street in front of them. They are boxed in!! *
SUDDENLY headlights illuminate the Licker. The noise *
of a roaring car engine makes the creature turn to see - *
A ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM - pimped up Moscow style. Doing
80 and headed straight towards it. The Uber Licker
ROARS as the Rolls POWERSLIDES, hitting it side on and
flinging it into a department store window. Stunned,
the Licker crashes around in the window display,
crushing mannequins, trying to right itself.
LUTHER’S P.O.V. --
As the Rolls slides to a halt beside him. A door opens
to reveal Alice at the wheel.
ALICE
(casual)
Hi ...
LUTHER
Nice whip.
ALICE
Well, this is Moscow.
CLOSE ON THE BACK WHEELS --
As they spin, burning rubber, and the Rolls peels out.
133 INT. PHANTOM 133
Barry and Leon are in the back. Luther rides shotgun.
BARRY *
What the hell was that thing *
doing with all those people? *
ALICE *
Cocooning them ... *
OFF Barry’s look in the rear view -- *
ALICE (CONT’D) *
Saving them for food. *
Luther cooly introduces everyone - like they were *
taking a relaxed Sunday joyride.
LUTHER
Barry, Leon ... Alice. *
ALICE
Pleased to meet you. You might
want to buckle up ...
64.
131 CONTINUED: 131
(CONTINUED)
She pulls a hand-brake turn at 70 mph, the G-Force *
sends the RIMS flying off the car.
BARRY
(to Leon)
I can see why we came for her...
134 EXT. GUM DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS 134 *
The Uber Licker finally frees itself from the store
front and races in pursuit. It’s PISSED!! *
135 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 135
Luther smiles at Alice --
LUTHER
Nice to see you again.
Alice smiles right back at him --
ALICE
Nice to be seen.
Leon glances back and sees the Licker coming. *
LEON
It’s gaining. *
ALICE
Not a problem.
(turns to Luther -
flirtatious)
So ... Did you miss me?
LUTHER
Really? We’re going to do this
right now?
ALICE
(shrugs)
No time like the present.
136 EXT. “MOSCOW” STREETS - CONTINUOUS 136 *
The Phantom weaves between abandoned and burnt-out
vehicles, but the Uber Licker just charges straight *
through them - simply crushing the vehicles or tossing
them aside.
137 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 137
Alice checks the rear view. The creature is getting *
REALLY close. Luther looks up ahead. Sees something --
65.
133 CONTINUED: 133
(CONTINUED)
LUTHER
Alice ...
She doesn’t seem to pay attention.
LUTHER (CONT’D)
(insistent)
Alice ... Car!!
LUTHER’S P.O.V. --
Another car’s headlights - coming straight for them. A
COLLISION COURSE!!
LUTHER (CONT’D)
CAR!!!
But Alice just accelerates harder. She’s going to ram
the oncoming vehicle at suicidal speed.
Luther and the others brace for impact!
At the last second, Alice pulls a BOOTLEGGER REVERSE.
Developed by moonshine bootleggers when faced with a
police roadblock, this manoeuver spins the car through
180 degrees while it’s still moving. Alice executes it
at 80 mph!!!
The Phantom spins around as the pursuing Licker CRASHES *
HEADLONG into the solid mirrored walls of the test
environment!! There was no oncoming car - just the
reflection of Alice’s vehicle in the mirrored wall.
138 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - CONTINUOUS 138 *
The Phantom erupts from a side street. No sign of the
pursuing Licker. *
139 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 139
Luther and Barry are PUMPED!! High-5 one another.
BARRY
Now that was some driving!!!
LUTHER
Some Moscow driving!!!
Strangely, Leon doesn’t seem as pleased.
LEON
(to Alice)
Where’s Ada?
66.
137 CONTINUED: 137
(CONTINUED)
ALICE
I don’t think she made it. I’m
sorry.
ANGLE ON LEON --
As this sinks in.
LEON
You saw her die?
ALICE
No.
Leon nods to himself.
LEON
She’s tough ...
The reflective moment is shattered as the back
windshield EXPLODES into a thousand pieces.
140 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - CONTINUOUS 140 *
The Phantom is being pursued by two flatbeds mounted
with machine guns and rocket launchers - the same
vehicles from the Kremlin siege. Flying through the
air to land behind them are also a half dozen
motorcycles - all ridden by the Las Plagas Undead.
Within a heartbeat, the Phantom is the centre of a
perfect storm of gunfire.
141 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 141
ALICE
Boys ... if you wouldn’t mind.
BARRY
Our pleasure.
He leans out of the back of the shattered back window *
and lets the Undead have it with both barrels.
142 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - CONTINUOUS 142 *
Luther and Leon lean out of the side windows and join *
the high speed shoot-out. Behind the wheel, Alice does
her best to avoid burnt-out vehicles and evade the
worst of the gunfire.
67.
139 CONTINUED: 139
143 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 143
A Las Plagas Undead riding a motorcycle pulls
alongside, raises a machine gun and fires.
Alice DUCKS as the side window shatters.
144 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - CONTINUOUS 144 *
Alice pulls on the wheel and the Phantom SIDESWIPES the
Undead. He loses control of the motorcycle and CRASHES
into a newsstand in spectacular fashion.
145 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 145
An RPG streaks towards the Phantom. Alice JOGS the
wheel to one side and it narrowly misses, exploding
harmlessly in front of the Phantom. Alice drives clean
THROUGH the fireball. Luther ducks back inside -
driven in by the flame. He turns to look at Alice.
LUTHER
Let me know when you plan on
doing that again.
Alice glances in the rear view.
ALICE
Heads up ...
She jogs the wheel again as another RPG hurtles past
them, EXPLODING alongside the Phantom.
146 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - CONTINUOUS 146 *
A motorcycle comes at the Phantom head on - A COLLISION *
COURSE. The Undead FIRES a machine gun over the
handlebars as he comes.
147 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 147
Alice sees him coming.
ALICE
Down!!!
Her warning comes just in time as the front windshield
BLOWS OUT and the car is riddled with bullets.
68.
148 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - CONTINUOUS 148 *
The motorbike and Phantom race at one another. Neither
flinching. Both accelerating.
149 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 149
Alice throws the car into a 180 spin. She is now *
driving backwards!! *
150 EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - CONTINUOUS 150 *
At the last millisecond Alice opens her door. The *
Undead and his motorcycle SLAM into the heavy door,
ripping it clean off and WIPING OUT in spectacular
fashion!!! *
Alice casually spins the car through another 180 spin *
and resumes on her original course. *
151 INT/EXT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 151
Leon leans out of the open doorway to check the fate of
the Undead. He sees something else instead. Something
that doesn’t please him.
LEON
Guess who’s back ... *
152 EXT. MOSCOW STREET - CONTINUOUS 152 *
The fallen Undead’s motorcycle is CRUSHED underfoot by
a GIANT CLAW.
153 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 153
Alice looks back to see the two Uber Lickers chasing
them. They’re gaining fast. In the lead is the *
MANGLED LICKER that had crashed into the giant mirror. *
Still alive and more pissed than ever. *
ALICE
Almost there!
LUTHER
Where?
69.
154 EXT. RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 154
The Phantom power-slides back into Red Square and races *
past a sign directing pedestrians to the subway
station. Behind the car, the Uber Lickers push the *
pursuing undead out of the way - crashing their *
vehicles into the ornate walls of Resurrection Gate. *
For these creatures, especially the Mangled Licker, *
this pursuit is becoming personal!! *
155 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 155
ALICE
Brace for impact!!!
She jerks the wheel to one side and --
156 EXT. RED SQUARE 156
The Phantom hits some construction works at the edge of *
the Square and jumps high in the air. SLOW TIME -- for *
an EPIC shot showing the Phantom caught twenty feet off *
the ground, slowly arcing through the air. *
CRASH back to REAL TIME as the Phantom hits the ground
at 70 mph and disappears down the steps to the Moscow *
Underground!! *
157 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 157
The passengers hold tight - taken on Alice’s wild ride.
The Phantom is jolted apart with the impact of the
seemingly endless stairs - Alice is still doing 50 mph
and headed straight down!!
158 EXT. RED SQUARE - ENTRANCE TO THE UNDERGROUND - 158
CONTINUOUS
The two Uber Lickers follow straight down the steps in
pursuit.
159 INT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 159
Alice sees the Lickers - gaining on them.
ALICE
Hold on!!!! *
70.
160 INT. MOSCOW UNDERGROUND - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 160
The Phantom hammers down the endless stairs pursued by *
the giant creatures. The imagery is spectacular!!! *
At the bottom of the stairs is an archway that is under *
repair. Scaffolding towers hold a portion of the *
ceiling up. *
Alice power slides the Rolls into the scaffolding, *
causing the roof to collapse, blocking the tunnel and *
stopping the pursuit of the Lickers. *
161 INT/EXT. PHANTOM - CONTINUOUS 161 *
The car is a wreck. *
ALICE
Everyone okay?
LEON
We’ll live.
Two of the remaining car doors fall off. *
162 OMITTED 162 *
163 INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM 163 *
Alice, Leon and the others make their way through the *
abandoned station. There is no sign of life. Alice *
calls out --
ALICE
Hello!!! We’re back. You can
come out now.
Rain and Becky emerge from their hiding place. Becky *
runs straight into Alice’s arms.
BECKY
You came back!! I knew you
would. I was so brave.
(to Rain)
I wasn’t scared at all, was I?
RAIN
You were very brave.
Luther looks at the little girl holding onto Alice.
LUTHER
Who’s this?
71.
(CONTINUED)
BECKY
I’m Becky.
ALICE
(to herself)
Becky.
We realize that this is the first time Alice has
actually heard Becky’s name.
BECKY
I’m very pleased to meet you.
(turns to Alice -
proud)
This is my mom.
LUTHER
Your Mom?
Off Luther’s surprised look --
ALICE
Long story.
CLOSE ON LEON’S COUNTDOWN CLOCK --
LEON
(concerned)
Twenty-two minutes left.
Luther glances towards the stairs. He can still hear
the sound of claw on metal -- the Lickers trying to
break through.
LUTHER
There’s no going back the way we
came.
BARRY
And we lost the map with Sergei.
ALICE
I got it.
Alice pulls out the mini computer that Ada gave her.
She pulls up schematics of the test floor. Studies
them. Plots a route.
ALICE (CONT’D)
There. We take this tunnel
here.
She indicates one of the subway tunnels leading out of
the station and into the darkness.
72.
163 CONTINUED: 163

ALICE (CONT’D)
At the end there’s a service
shaft that connects with the
submarine pens.
LEON
Then let’s go.
INT. MOSCOW UNDERGROUND *
Behind the abandoned Rolls Royce, the rubble blocking *
off the Lickers is beginning to move. A GIANT CLAW *
PUNCHES THROUGH!! *
164 INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL 164 *
Alice and the others make their way down the tunnel.
Dark silhouettes against the distant light of the
subway station.
ALICE
How did you end up working for *
Wesker? *
LEON
(snaps) *
I don’t work for him. *
Leon stares at Alice for a moment. Hard to read his *
thoughts. *
LEON (CONT’D) *
But things on the surface have *
changed. Everyone thought it *
was important to have you with *
us. *
(beat) *
But I don’t know if I would have *
risked so much for one person.
ALICE
I’m sorry. About Ada. You and
she ...
LEON
Don’t fish. I don’t know you
well enough.
Alice nods. Know when to back off --
ALICE
Okay then ...
73.
163 CONTINUED: (2) 163
165 INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER 165
The tunnel dead ends. A metal staircase leads upwards. *
Alice lowers Ada’s computer and glances up. *
ALICE
Access shaft to the submarine
pens. *
Alice leads the way -- *
ALICE (CONT’D) *
Come on.
Unseen by the others, Alice checks her wound again. *
After the violent action in the car it is much, much *
worse - she’s bleeding out. *
DISTANT ANGLE --
On the tiny human figures. Being watched from afar.
Suddenly something moves - A FAMILIAR HINT OF TOOTH AND
CLAW. THE LICKERS ARE BACK!! *
166 INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM 166 *
Jill Valentine and her team march across the platform. *
Kaplan consults his wrist computer.
KAPLAN
They’ve reached the submarine
pens. Headed for the elevators.
VALENTINE
Bring up the power grid.
KAPLAN
Yes Ma’am.
167 INT. SUBMARINE PENS 167
Alice, Leon and the others emerge from a shaft close to
the Typhoon subs. Leon checks his countdown watch.
LEON
Eleven minutes ... we’re going
to be okay.
They head for the elevator shaft.
168 INT. UMBRELLA FACILITY - BASE OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 168
LUTHER
Get on board.

(CONTINUED)
Luther helps Becky, Rain and the others climb onto the
giant freight platform. *
BARRY
Hold on.
Barry stands by the controls.
BARRY (CONT’D) *
Next stop, menswear and sporting
goods.
He hits a switch and the elevator platform begins to
rise. They’re getting out of here!
It makes it seven feet and then JOLTS to a halt and the
lights in the chamber GO OUT. They are replaced by
dim, strobing EMERGENCY LIGHTS. The room suddenly
takes on a dark, menacing feel.
LEON
Barry! What is it?
BARRY
I don’t know.
LUTHER
Main control panel’s down there.
Luther indicates a metal box by the tunnel to the
submarine pens.
LUTHER (CONT’D)
Hold on.
Luther hops off the platform.
LEON
Go with him.
Alice nods. Follows Luther. Covers him while Luther
opens the control panel. Leon appears behind Alice and
Luther. He’s on edge. Leon stares into the submarine
pens. No sign of their pursuers.
LUTHER
Looks like somebody cut the
power remotely.
LEON
Can you get it back online?
LUTHER
(shakes his head)
Maybe Sergei could have, but ...
Leon glances at his countdown watch.
75.
168 CONTINUED: 168
(CONTINUED)
LEON
Nine minutes. Looks like we’re
going with Plan B.
(off Luther’s look)
There’s a reason we planted
those explosives.
SUDDENLY BECKY SCREAMS!!!
Alice turns to see a horrifying sight. Caught in the
flickering strobe lights, an Uber Licker hangs above *
the elevator platform. *
ON THE ELEVATOR PLATFORM --
Barry draws his weapons, but the Uber Licker SPITS *
forth a stream of ACID BILE from its gaping jaws. Used
to dissolve the flesh of its prey in preparation for
consumption, this acid immediately begins eating into
Barry’s skin and clothing.
BARRY
Aaaaaaaah!!!!
BECKY’S P.O.V. --
As the Uber Licker wraps its tongue around her in a *
second, rendering her helpless.
RAIN
No!!!
Rain charges valiantly, gun blazing - just as Alice
taught her. The Uber Licker mauls Rain with its Giant *
Claws. She screams in pain, as the Uber Licker flings *
her around like a rag doll!! Moments later, it hurls *
her crumpled body across the room.
ANGLE ON ALICE --
Trying to get a shot, but the Uber Licker is gone in a *
flash - taking Becky with it. Luther races over to
Rain’s body. Checks her pulse --
LUTHER
She’s dead.
On the elevator platform Leon kneels over Barry. He
has stripped off his combat armor and webbing before
the acid could burn through - it lies in a smoking pile
on the ground. But one side of his face is badly
burnt.
LEON
Talk to me Barry.
BARRY
Feel like shit ...
76.
168 CONTINUED: (2) 168
(CONTINUED)
Leon unwraps a sterile medi-pad. Presses it to Barry’s
burnt face.
LEON
Here ... this should help.
Hold it in place.
Barry shudders in pain. Looks Leon in the eye. Dead
serious --
BARRY
Tell me. Honestly. How bad is
it?
LEON
You know ...
Leon hesitates. Barry braces himself for the worst --
LEON (CONT’D)
... I think that thing improved *
your looks.
Barry laughs, but it’s painful.
BARRY
Son of a bitch ... Don’t make me
laugh!!
Leon looks at his countdown watch.
LEON
Seven minutes then we’re out of
here. You hang on in there ...
we’ll get you help topside.
Barry nods. Leon stands to see Alice preparing her
weapons. She glances up at the AIR VENT into which the
Uber Licker dragged Becky. A narrow metal ladder leads *
up to it.
LEON (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
ALICE
I’m going to get her.
LEON
(shakes his head)
I didn’t lose this many friends
to have you just walk away.
ALICE
I plan on coming back.
Leon blocks her way.
77.
168 CONTINUED: (3) 168
(CONTINUED)
LEON
Don’t do this. You’re more
important than she is.
ALICE
Well, that’s where you’re wrong.
LEON
This is a mistake.
ALICE
(deadly serious)
Step aside.
Leon knows this can only end in a fight. Reluctantly,
he steps away. Alice walks to the base of the ladder.
Luther hands her a flashlight.
LUTHER
Take this.
ALICE
(smiles)
Don’t be leaving without me.
LUTHER
In seven minutes we won’t have a
choice.
He takes off his Countdown Watch.
LUTHER (CONT’D)
Here.
Luther fastens it to her wrist. It clicks over from 7
minutes to 6:59 -- 6:58 --
LUTHER (CONT’D)
Don’t be late ...
Alice nods. She starts to climb. Luther watches as
she disappears into the air vent.
LUTHER (CONT’D)
(under his breath)
Good luck.
SUDDENLY GUNFIRE EXPLODES AROUND HIM!!!
BARRY
We have guests!!!
As Luther and Leon take cover, they see that Jill
Valentine and her team have reached the submarine pens -
and they don’t plan on taking prisoners.
78.
168 CONTINUED: (4) 168
169 INT. AIR VENTS - JUNCTION 169
The muffled sound of gunfire far below.
CLOSE ON -- Alice’s eyes as they appear over the lip of
an air shaft. It’s dark, airless, claustrophobic and
very, very scary. There could be absolutely anything
hiding up here.
The shaft stretches into infinity both ways, no sign of *
which way to go. Then Alice sees something - lying in
the shaft. She goes over to the object and picks it
up. It’s Becky’s discarded backpack.
As Alice steps forward, she suddenly stumbles and *
almost falls. Her head spins. She grabs her wounded *
side. She has lost so much blood, she is on the verge *
of blacking out. *
Taking a moment to steady herself, Alice grits her *
teeth and presses on. *
170 INT. UMBRELLA FACILITY - BASE OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 170
Leon and Luther are engaged in a vicious firefight with
Jill Valentine’s team. Even Barry, half blind and
badly wounded is helping out. In fact, he seems to be
more deadly than ever --
BARRY
That’s right!!!
He downs an Umbrella Trooper with a burst of gunfire.
BARRY (CONT’D)
You like that?!!
171 INT. SUBMARINE PENS - CONTINUOUS 171
Jill and her team are making no headway.
VALENTINE
Bring up the Railgun!!
One and Rain begin to unpack the deadly piece of
hardware.

As Luther and Barry continue to fire, Leon checks his
countdown watch. 2:46 -- 2:45 -- 2:44 --

LEON
(to Luther)
Your friend better hurry up!!
173 INT. AIR VENTS 173
Another shaft appears directly above her - going *
straight up. The walls of this shaft are coated in a *
trail of glistening slime. *
Alice covers her flashlight and peers into the darkness
above her. There’s a cool blue light coming from
another shaft thirty feet above. It illuminates Becky - *
- wrapped in a COCOON, struggling to be free. Alice is *
about to step forward when she suddenly senses *
something. *
ANGLE ON ALICE -- *
Seen from far above. The Mangled Uber Licker lurks in *
the shadows - waiting to pounce. It has set Becky as a *
trap for Alice. The cunning feral creature wants *
revenge. *
174 INT. BASE OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 174
The concrete walls of the elevator chamber are being
turned to swiss cheese by the Railgun. Leon checks his
countdown watch. 1:47 -- 1:46 -- 1:45 -- Leon turns
to Luther and Barry, shouting to be heard over the
gunfire --
LEON
Get back to the elevator. Less
than two minutes. We have to
move. Now!
Luther heads out, but Barry doesn’t move.
BARRY
You go. I’m just going to wait
here awhile.
LEON
Barry ...
BARRY
When the countdown hits zero,
you have to be on that elevator,
and someone has to stay here.
Besides ...
He lets loose another huge volley of machine-gun fire.
BARRY (CONT’D)
... I’m kinda enjoying myself!!

Barry turns around. Leon is still standing there.
BARRY (CONT’D)
You still here? Go!!
175 INT. AIR VENTS 175
Alice holds Ada’s hookgun in her hand. The vertical
shaft is directly above her. Alice takes a deep breath
and --
FIRES.
176 INT. VERTICAL SHAFT - CONTINUOUS 176 *
CLOSE ON --
The grappling hook as it wraps around a metal pipe. *
CRASH ZOOM BACK --
To reveal the Mangled Uber Licker, lying in wait for *
Alice. The Creature turns as the cable attached to the *
grappling hook PULLS TIGHT and drags Alice into the air *
at 70 mph. She FLIES through the air, arcing over the *
Uber Licker, firing as she goes. *
As Alice lands, the Licker collapses behind her - dead. *
ALICE
Becky!!! *
Alice tears away at the cocoon holding Becky prisoner. *
Becky can barely contain herself --
BECKY
Thank you ... I knew you’d *
come. I knew you wouldn’t leave *
me ... *
Suddenly behind them the Mangled Licker rises to its *
feet!!! Alice turns as the Licker lets loose a deathly *
WAIL and finally collapses. Dead at last. *
But moments later, the Licker’s death rattle is *
answered. The sound of distant cries - rapidly growing *
closer. Other Lickers are coming!! *
Alice picks up Becky and runs into -- *
INT. CRYOSTASIS CHAMBER *
Alice looks around. She is in a giant circular chamber *
that rises a hundred feet high. The walls are lined *
with hundreds of human clones, ready to be awoken. *

174 CONTINUED: 174
(CONTINUED)
Alice can’t help but hesitate when she sees a dozen *
sleeping clones, all an exact copy of herself. Then *
beside them, a dozen blue copies of Rain. And beside *
her a dozen copies of One, Kaplan and the Medic. *
177 INT. BASE OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 177 *
Leon and Luther clamber onto the elevator platform.
Leon looks back at Barry - still heroically holding
back the Umbrella troops.
LEON
(to Luther)
Strap yourself down.
Luther wraps his belt tightly around the elevator
handrail. Whatever they’re expecting - it’s going to
be intense.
178 INT. CRYOSTASIS CHAMBER 178
Still fleeing the sound of the pursuing Lickers, Alice *
(carrying Becky in her arms) rounds a corner and stops *
dead. Up ahead, she senses movement. Nothing visible,
just the slightest flicker in the shadows - but to
trained eyes ...
Meanwhile, Becky is looking at the foreground - a dozen
cryo-tubes, each holding a dozen clones of Alice. Of
her mother.
BECKY
(shocked)
Who are they?
Alice doesn’t reply. She’s watching the shadows - more
movement. At least a dozen Lickers and Uber Lickers *
emerging from the shadows, cutting off their escape
route. They are everywhere. Becky is still looking at *
the clones of Alice --
BECKY (CONT’D)
Who ... are they?
She stares at Alice. Trying to comprehend.
BECKY (CONT’D)
Who are you?
Alice doesn’t know what to say. She drops something at
her feet. A belt of grenades - incendiaries.
BECKY (CONT’D)
You are my mommy ... aren’t you?
CLOSE ON ALICE
82.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
As the Lickers charge. Moments from death, the words *
finally come to her --
ALICE
I am now.
WITH THE LICKERS -- *
Leaping for Alice and Becky.
ON ALICE --
As she raises Ada’s hookgun. And FIRES.
In an instant, Alice and Becky are pulled from the
clutches of the Lickers. As they hurtle upwards, Alice *
draws her pistol and fires again, hitting the belt of
grenades!!
WITH ALICE AND BECKY --
Winched upwards in the most awesome TRAILER SHOT as the
room EXPLODES into a lake of napalm fire below them.
The Lickers are consumed in an instant. *
179 INT. BASE OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 179
Leon looks at his countdown watch. 00:02 -- 00:01 --
00:00 --
180 EXT. TOPSIDE - SOVIET FACILITY - INTAKE VENTS - 180
CONTINUOUS
The three large towers standing by the water’s edge.
Each contains a huge rotating fan - sucking air down
into the facility far below.
CLOSE ON --
The explosives that Luther and Barry set earlier.
Their counters reach 00:00, and they are TORN APART by
the shaped charges.
181 INT. INTAKE VENTS - CONTINUOUS 181
The vents rupture and millions of gallons of freezing
seawater FLOOD IN!!
EXT. UNDERWATER - UMBRELLA FACILITY - CONTINUOUS *
With the pressure of the structure compromised, the *
giant underwater structure can no longer maintain its *
integrity. It begins to IMPLODE. *
83.
178 CONTINUED: 178
182 INT. TEST FLOOR - NEW YORK - TIMES SQUARE 182 *
A moment of calm. Undead wander through the abandoned *
streets. Then suddenly, the rapidly building noise of
water. A lot of water. A giant TIDAL WAVE of
seawater sweeps across the test floor, destroying
everything in its path. Down the length of Times *
Square, it picks up cars and people, tossing them aside *
like toys. *
183 EXT. BRANDENBURG GATE 183 *
The massive wave of seawater is over two hundred feet *
high when it hits the Brandenburg Gate, tearing *
Victoria (the Roman Goddess of Victory), her chariot *
and its four horses from their perch. *
184 OMITTED 184 *
185 INT. TEST FLOOR - “MOSCOW” - RED SQUARE 185 *
Las Plagas Undead try to outrun the tidal wave, but are
swept away as the mountain of water SWEEPS through the
Moscow streets and CRASHES against the Kremlin.
186 INT. SUBMARINE PENS 186
Jill Valentine hears the roar of the oncoming water.
VALENTINE
Run!!
Valentine and Rain flee, but One stays at his post,
blasting away at Barry, engaged in some personal
vendetta. At the last minute he looks up to see the
oncoming tidal wave and is SWEPT AWAY in an instant.
187 INT. BASE OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 187
Barry relaxes, lights up his signature cigar and take a
drag.
BARRY
(satisfied)
Yeah ...
A second later, he is gone, buried by the raging
torrent of water.
84.
188 INT. ELEVATOR PLATFORM 188
ON LUTHER --
LUTHER
(shocked)
She didn’t make it ...
Leon shouts above the noise of the oncoming wall of
water --
LEON
Hold on!!
The seawater hits the bottom of the elevator shaft and
SURGES UPWARDS - taking the freight platform with it.
Like the cork in a bottle of champagne - driven upwards
by the force of the liquid. Leon and Luther are half
drowned, but holding on for dear life.
LUTHER’S P.O.V. --
As he sees Alice kick out the cover of an air shaft,
far above.
LUTHER
Alice!!
But the freight platform is gaining fast.
ON ALICE --
As she leaps, Becky held in her arms.
Alice hits the edge of the platform. Becky tumbles to
safety, but Alice falls back -- into the raging waters.
CLOSE ON LEON --
As he grabs Alice and drags her to safety.
LEON
Nice timing.
189 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT 189
From far above, we see the freight platform driven
upwards at high speed.
190 INT. ELEVATOR PLATFORM 190
Alice clings to Becky and the railing beside Leon.
85.
(CONTINUED)
ALICE
(to Leon)
I thought I told you not to
leave without me.
Luther smiles.
LUTHER
Glad you could make it.
ANGLE ON LEON --
As he flips a panel on the elevator control, to reveal
a switch that says, --
EMERGENCY BRAKE
191 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY - SILO SHAFT 191
The freight platform hurtles out into the broader silo,
propelled by a huge high pressure geyser of seawater.
But as the geyser loses velocity and falls away, the
platform begins to slow, stop, and then fall.
192 EXT. ELEVATOR PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 192
Leon hits the switch for the Emergency Brakes, and the
platform locks in place. He glances up. Still another
thirty feet from the surface. A metal access ladder
runs up the silo wall.
LEON
Now we climb.
193 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY DAY. 193
As Alice and the others crest the top of the silo, we
can see they are already suffering from severe exposure
to the deep cold.
LEON
(to Luther)
Get them to shelter!! *
194 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE 194 *
Luther bundles Alice and Becky into one of the Umbrella
Sprytes they discovered before their descent. He *
starts the engine and cranks the heaters to max. In
the back he finds black and red Umbrella Jackets that
he breaks out for the girls.
86.
190 CONTINUED: 190
195 EXT. SOVIET FACILITY 195
Leon patches into a communications tower. Types out a
quick message --
“FLASH TRAFFIC. URGENT. TARGET ACQUIRED. LSK.”
He looks up. In the distance a huge storm is
approaching fast. A churning wall of snow travelling
at 100 mph, consuming everything in its path.
196 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE 196 *
Leon joins Luther, Alice and Becky.
LEON
Storm. 3 miles out. We’d
better hurry. Looks like it’s
going to be a whiteout.
Luther hits the gas, and the Spryte pulls out. *
197 EXT. KAMCHATKA PENINSULAR - AERIAL SHOT 197
2,000 feet above the ice. The tiny black and red
Spryte pulls onto the frozen pack ice of the bay, *
leaving the Soviet Facility far behind.
198 BENEATH THE PACK ICE -- 198
We see the bottom of the Spryte through the ice. The *
ice groans, but doesn’t crack.
199 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE 199 *
ALICE
I’m guessing you didn’t drive
from Los Angeles?
LUTHER
There’s a town across the bay.
We landed at the airport there.
Quickest way back is to cross
the pack ice. Should be there
in six hours. So sit back and
relax.
But Alice seems distracted. She is staring up at a
flock of birds flying overhead - fleeing from the
storm.
LUTHER (CONT’D)
Are you okay?
87.
(CONTINUED)
Alice nods.
LUTHER (CONT’D)
What are you looking at?
ALICE
The sky ...
(beat)
The real world.
LUTHER
You had doubts?
ALICE
Just checking.
200 EXT. PACK ICE 200
The Spryte churns its way across the frozen sea. Past *
the mothballed Russian Fleet. In the distance, the *
storm sweeps towards them. Only now do we begin to *
appreciate its vast scale. The Spryte looks like a *
tiny toy.
201 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE 201 *
The storm is almost upon them.
LEON
(to Luther)
Hit the lights.
202 EXT. PACK ICE - AERIAL SHOT 202
The storm hits the Spryte, consuming it in a heartbeat. *
203 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE 203 *
The vehicle is buffeted by the 100 mph winds. Even
with the floodlights on, visibility is virtually zero.
It’s a total WHITEOUT. But Luther doesn’t slow the
vehicle. Leon turns to Alice and Becky.
LEON
(reassuring)
Don’t worry. We steer by
compass. The pack ice is flat -
nothing to run into out here.
204 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE - LATER 204 *
The whiteout still rages around them. Becky has fallen
asleep in Alice’s arms. Alice is also fast asleep.
88.
199 CONTINUED: 199
(CONTINUED)
Intertwined and at peace, they really do look like
mother and daughter.
Suddenly the Spryte lurches violently to one side. *
Waking them.
LUTHER
What the hell!!!
LEON
Stop!!
Luther brakes and the Spryte slides to a halt. *
ALICE
What is it?
LEON
I’m not sure.
The Spryte lurches again, almost tipping onto its side. *
205 EXT. PACK ICE - CONTINUOUS 205
Cracks appear in the pack ice - spreading beneath the
Spryte, causing it to lurch violently to one side. *
AN OVERHEAD SHOT --
Reveals that the pack ice all around the sno cat is
breaking. Beneath the vehicle, something is RISING OUT
OF THE ICE!!!
206 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE 206 *
A GIANT BLACK MONOLITH rises out of the ice right
beside the Spryte. *
LUTHER
What the hell is that?!
A huge piece of pack ice is overturned by the Monolith -
taking the Spryte with it. Alice, Becky, Leon and *
Luther are tossed around like rag dolls as the vehicle
FLIPS OVER and lands on its roof!
207 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE - CONTINUOUS 207 *
The World is upside down. Alice finds Becky in the
chaos.
ALICE
Becky!!! Are you hurt?
BECKY
No ... I’m okay.
89.
204 CONTINUED: 204
(CONTINUED)
ALICE
You’re sure?
BECKY
I’m okay ... really.
Behind her, Luther groans.
LUTHER
Shit ...
ALICE
Luther?
LUTHER
Think I broke my arm.
ALICE
(indicates Becky)
Stay here with her.
208 EXT. PACK ICE 208
Alice crawls from the wrecked Spryte to see -- *
Freezing cold water pouring from the Monolith. It
stands thirty feet above the surface of the broken ice.
Only now do we see what it really is. The conning
tower of a giant Typhoon Class submarine. One of the
two from the submarine pens of the Umbrella base.
Alice is joined by Leon. They watch as a hatch opens
at the bottom of the tower and two silhouetted figures
emerge. They advance through the swirling snowstorm --
it’s Jill Valentine and Rain.
ALICE
Only the two of you?
VALENTINE
It’ll be enough.
Rain produces a high tech syringe. She INJECTS the
contents into her own neck.
CLOSE ON THE TUBE --
As the bright red liquid disappears into her
bloodstream. A small CREATURE writhes within.
LEON
The Las Plagas parasite.
Rain’s whole body CONTORTS. Her veins bulge
unnaturally. Her eyes BLAZE with an unearthly red
light. As one, the two women attack - Valentine and
Rain - lightning fast and deadly.
90.
207 CONTINUED: 207
(CONTINUED)
Jill Valentine comes for Alice. Alice fires, but Jill
leaps and TWISTS in the air - her signature move - the
bullets missing her by microns.
ON RAIN --
As she charges Leon. He fires, hitting Rain multiple
times. Rain halts, but doesn’t fall. We see ripples *
in her flesh. Something is moving under the surface of *
the skin - like dozen of beetles making their way *
across Rain’s body to her arms and down to her hands. *
Then they finally reach her finger tips and drop out of *
the end of the fingers!! *
CLOSE ON THE GROUND -- *
As dozens of bullets fall to the pavement. Purged from *
the Rain’s body. Rain rears her head and howls in *
triumph. Leon raises his gun to fire again, but Rain *
is TOO FAST. A spinning kick sends him flying.
ON JILL VALENTINE --
As she lands, knocking aside Alice’s weapons. The two
engage in a fierce battle. Alice now armed with two *
ice axes and Valentine with a telescoping metallic *
staff. But whatever move Alice makes, Jill seems to *
predict it, block it or avoid it. It’s an EPIC FIGHT *
SCENE. Alternating between rapid fire cuts and SUPER *
SLO MO for maximum impact!! But the fight ends with *
Alice, out-matched and out-classed, being FLUNG through
the air.
209 INT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE - CONTINUOUS 209 *
Alice CRASHES half through the windshield. Becky
reacts in shock, then screams as Alice is dragged back
out by Valentine --
BECKY
Mommy!! *
Luther pushes Becky behind the overturned seats of the
Spryte. *
LUTHER
Hide back there.
210 EXT. PACK ICE - CONTINUOUS 210
Rain and Leon continue their furious hand to hand
combat. Leon unleashes his full arsenal - kicks,
punches, blocks, jabs - but all to no avail. The Las
Plagas has made Rain unnaturally strong and fast.
91.
208 CONTINUED: 208
211 EXT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE - CONTINUOUS 211 *
Valentine pummels Alice mercilessly. One blow lands in *
Alice’s bloody side. The pain is excruciating. *
Sensing weakness, Valentine hits the wound over and *
over again. The pain is so great, Alice almost passes *
out. She pitches forward and is caught by Valentine. *
She lifts Alice by the throat. *
The tracks of the overturned Spryte are still spinning. *
They are fitted with razor sharp blades designed to cut
into thick snow and ice. Valentine forces Alice’s face *
towards the deadly spinning blades. Alice fights for
her life, but the blades come CLOSER and CLOSER.
212 EXT. PACK ICE - CONTINUOUS 212
Leon is becoming exhausted. He musters the last of his
strength and launches one final, devastating attack on
Rain. She blocks with minimal effort and KICKS Leon
squarely in the chest. He FLIES through the air and
SLAMS into the conning tower of the submarine.
213 EXT. UMBRELLA SPRYTE - CONTINUOUS 213 *
Alice fights for her life. Her face is a FRACTION OF
AN INCH from the rotating blades. In a matter of
seconds they will tear her flesh clean off.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
Suddenly the fight goes out of her. Her hands drop
away from Valentine’s.
CLOSE ON JILL VALENTINE --
Realizing she has won. She forces Alice’s face into
the blades -- but then suddenly STOPS. She looks down
in surprise.
VALENTINE’S P.O.V. --
Alice has her hand on the HIGH TECH SCARAB mounted on
Jill’s chest. With one sharp move Alice RIPS it
free!!! Valentine slumps to the ground. Like a
marionette who’s strings have been suddenly cut.
Alice flings the Scarab away. It lands in the snow,
but immediately FLIPS itself back up and begins to race
back to Valentine - like a parasite looking for its
host.
WITH THE SCARAB --
92.
(CONTINUED)
Scuttling across the snow and ice -- headed for the
helpless Jill Valentine. It reaches Jill, leaps, but
at the last second Alice BLASTS IT TO OBLIVION.
214 EXT. PACK ICE - CONTINUOUS 214
Leon slumps at the foot of the submarine. Bruised and
broken. As Rain approaches, he struggles to his feet.
He swings one last time, putting every fibre of his
body into a killer blow aimed straight at Rain’s head.
Just to have his hand caught by hers.
Rain smiles and tightens her fist. We hear Leon’s
knuckles shattering under the pressure. He buckles and
falls. Rain towers above him, ready to finish Leon
off, when suddenly she is SLAMMED to one side by Luther
-- wielding the only weapon he could find - a fire
extinguisher from the Spryte. *
ON RAIN --
As she stands back up. The damage to her head
immediately HEALING ITSELF.
ON LUTHER --
As he attempts to take another swing. But Rain moves
lightning fast - sending the extinguisher flying. She
strikes at Luther’s chest with one OPEN PALM.
IN SUPER SLOW MOTION --
A wide shot of Rain and Luther. A tableau caught in
time. We see Rain make contact with Luther’s chest.
Time has slowed so much that the flurries of snow are
hung motionless in the air.
Suddenly the camera ACCELERATES. Diving between the
snowflakes and disappearing WITHIN Luther’s body.
215 WITHIN LUTHER - CONTINUOUS -- 215
We see the effects of Rain’s OPEN PALM strike. A
SHOCKWAVE moves through his chest, breaking ribs and
pulverizing his internal organs. The shockwave reaches
his heart and it STOPS beating.
216 EXT. PACK ICE - CONTINUOUS 216
Luther falls to the ground dead.
ALICE
Luther!!!
93.
213 CONTINUED: 213
(CONTINUED)
Enraged, Alice charges Rain, shooting as she goes. But
Rain just absorbs the bullets.
IN SUPER SLOW MOTION --
A wide shot of Rain and Alice. A tableau caught in
time. Alice running and shooting. Rain readying her
deadly Open Palm Strike.
Rain strikes. Alice tries to block, but only partially
deflects the blow. Time has slowed so much that the
flurries of snow are hung motionless in the air.
Suddenly the camera ACCELERATES. Diving between the
snowflakes and disappearing WITHIN Alice’s body.
217 WITHIN ALICE - CONTINUOUS -- 217
We see the effects of Rain’s OPEN PALM strike -
partially deflected, but still incredibly powerful!! A
SHOCKWAVE moves through her chest, breaking ribs and
pulverizing her internal organs. The shockwave reaches
her heart. Already badly weakened, Alice’s heart *
wavers, then a moment later it STOPS beating *
altogether. *
218 EXT. PACK ICE - CONTINUOUS 218
Alice falls to her knees.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
Her dead eyes. Suddenly the spark of life returns.
Her heart begins to beat again. Alice struggles
painfully back to her feet. And is immediately
HAMMERED by a flurry of blows from Rain. A spinning *
kick sends Alice flies through the air, dropping her *
weapons and landing on the ice. Sliding to a halt,
Alice is barely clinging to life. All the fight has
gone out of her.
ON RAIN --
As she approaches through the flurries of snow. Ready
to finish Alice off.
ON ALICE --
As she struggles to her feet. Without weapons and
helpless.
ON JILL VALENTINE --
VALENTINE
Alice!!!
94.
216 CONTINUED: 216
(CONTINUED)
Jill Valentine is still recovering, but no longer under
control of the Umbrella Corporation. She slides her
gun across the ice to Alice. Alice kicks it into the
air with her foot and CATCHES it mid spin. Rain sneers
at the weapon --
RAIN
You can’t kill me.
ALICE
I don’t need to.
Alice fires - unloading the whole clip in a matter of
seconds. But not one shot is aimed at Rain. Instead,
Alice shoots out the ice under Rain’s feet. The pack
ice, already weakened by the submarine, CRACKS and
begins to BREAK APART.
Rain slips into the freezing water below. Try as she
might, she just can’t get a purchase on the ice. Her
mutated powers rendered useless, she slips deeper and
deeper into the water. Dragged down by her boots,
clothing and equipment. She grabs at floating pieces
of ice, but her efforts are futile --
RAIN
I’m coming back for you!! You
wait ... I’m coming back!
ALICE
I look forward to it.
And with that, Rain slips beneath the surface.
219 UNDERWATER -- 219
We watch Rain slip off the ice and sink far below.
Still very much alive, mutated and indestructible, but *
helpless to stop her descent into the depths.
After a moment she is gone. Lost in the darkness,
headed for the seabed.
220 EXT. PACK ICE 220
Exhausted, Alice sinks to the ground. Becky runs to
her side.
BECKY
Mommy!!
ALICE
I’m okay ... don’t worry.
For the first time, Becky sees the bloody wound in *
Alice’s side. *
95.
218 CONTINUED: 218
(CONTINUED)
BECKY *
You’re hurt!! *
ALICE *
I’m just fine. I’ll be okay ... *
But she doesn’t look it. Around them, the storm
suddenly seems to intensify. Alice looks to the sky.
Dozens of FLOATING LIGHTS illuminate the storm from
within - it looks like a giant spaceship descending
from the heavens.
BECKY
What is it?!
Leon and Jill struggle to Alice’s side through the
strengthening whiteout.
LEON
I called for back-up ...
Then the source of the lights becomes apparent. Not
one giant spaceship, but dozens of individual
helicopters. Their rotor blades driving flurries of
snow across the ice. Alice tries to stand, but has no
strength left. Instead, near death, she pitches over *
and we --
FADE TO
BLACK:
221 CLOSE ON ALICE’S EYE -- 221
As she awakens. The signature Resident Evil shot. Pull
back to reveal --
222 INT. HELICOPTER 222
The cargo hold of the helicopter has been outfitted as
a mobile medical bay.
Alice’s P.O.V. --
Still blurred. Coming slowly back to full
consciousness. Her wounds are now cleaned and *
bandaged. Jill Valentine leans over her -- *
VALENTINE
Glad to have you back ...
Suddenly the sound of the rotors change. They are
descending.
PILOT
Two minutes to the LZ.
96.
220 CONTINUED: 220
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. NIGHT. *
The helicopter banks past the Lincoln Memorial and the *
Washington Monument and descends towards -- *
223 EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - THE WHITE HOUSE NIGHT. 223 *
The area around the famous building has been converted *
into a makeshift fortress, filled with helicopter *
landing pads, missiles and tanks. Searchlights probe
the night sky. They lock onto Alice’s helicopter as it
comes in for a landing.
224 INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR 224 *
Alice, Becky, Valentine and Leon are led through the *
warn torn building. At the doorway to the Oval Office *
they are greeted by a familiar face -- *
ADA WONG
Glad you could make it.
LEON
(to Alice)
Told you she was tough ...
INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE *
Behind what was once the President’s desk sits a *
familiar BLACK CLAD FIGURE --
ALICE
Wesker ...
Alice instinctively reaches for her weapons - but of
course they are not there.
WESKER
No need for that. Umbrella and
I no longer see ... eye to eye.
ALICE
I killed you.
WESKER
(casual)
A clone.
(smiles)
You didn’t really think I’d put
myself in harm’s way did you?
LIGHTNING FAST, Wesker strikes, jamming a high-tech
syringe into Alice’s neck. Alice crumples to the
ground in agony.
97.
(CONTINUED)
ALICE
What was in there?! What have
you done to me?
WESKER
You were the only one to
successfully bond with the Tvirus
... to fully realize her
powers.
Within Alice -- we see the T-virus surging through her
bloodstream. The distinctive T-cells bonding with her
on a cellular level.
WESKER (CONT’D)
Well now, I have need of you.
The old you.
CLOSE ON ALICE --
As her eyes DILATE. Her powers coming back to her -
surging through her body. She clenches her fist and
SLAMS it against the stone floor with tremendous force.
Huge CRACKS spread out across the stone. Alice slowly
rises to her feet and faces Wesker --
ALICE
I’m going to kill you.
WESKER *
Perhaps. But first you have *
work to do ... *
225 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - ROOF NIGHT. 225 *
Wesker climbs the steps to the roof. Alice and the *
others follow.
WESKER
A lot has changed in the past
weeks. This is the last that
remains of us ... of the human
race itself.
(to Alice)
It seems we are bonded against a
common foe. This is why we
needed you back ...
Alice stares out in shock - at something we do not yet *
see.
WESKER (CONT’D)
This is humanity’s last stand...
THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
98.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
At first thousands, but then hundreds of thousands of
Undead surging against the walls of the makeshift *
fortress that has been erected around the White House. *
Troops on the walls using flame throwers, rocket
launchers and heavy machine guns fight an endless war
attempting to hold the horde back.
The rest of Washington, with all its familiar landmarks *
is revealed to be a burnt and blackened wasteland. The
White House with its searchlights and guard towers is *
the last beacon of light.
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK, REVEALING --
That the Undead are actually in their MILLIONS.
And they are being joined by hundreds of Lickers, Uber
Lickers, Mutated Dogs, Executioners, Giant Spiders -
all the creatures of the apocalypse, joined together in
a vast, seemingly endless army. All these forces of
darkness are pressing against the walls of the
increasingly fragile looking fortress. *
It is an awesome image, promising an epic battle to
come.
And just when it couldn’t get more spectacular. A
helicopter flies overhead, strafing the Undead below,
and is TORN OUT OF THE SKY by a flock of winged
creatures. Every giant, mutated monstrosity from the
games, gathered together in a storm cloud of fangs and
claws. The creatures of the apocalypse rule the night
sky as well!
As the helicopter drops from the sky like a fiery comet
and CRASHES into the camera we --
CUT TO
BLACK:
TO BE CONCLUDED IN --
RESIDENT EVIL: REVELATION *
99.
225 CONTINUED: 225
