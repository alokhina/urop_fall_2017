Matrix Revolutions, The (2003) Movie Script

I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.
Nothing but blue pills.
- Should we try to contact them?
- Won't matter. My gut says they're down.
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.
- Thought you could use something to eat.
- Thank you.
Any change?
No.
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.
At least until he wakes up.
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.
He'd better have some good answers.
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.
But like I said,
the answer better be good.
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.
- For what?
- For Neo.
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.
Please, for me.
This is what keeps bothering me.
What?
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?
Based on point of entry and the past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.
Jesus H. Christ.
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?
Operator.
It's Seraph.
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.
Good morning.
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.
Are you lost, Neo?
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.
- Why not?
- He won't let you.
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.
One thing I've learned in all my years...
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.
I'm sorry this had to happen.
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.
What choice?
To help you, to guide Neo.
Now, since the real test for any choice
is having to make the same choice again...
...knowing full well
what it might cost...
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...
...because here I am, at it again.
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.
The Merovingian.
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.
For years he has protected me.
I hope he can do the same for you.
Please, follow me.
Oracle...
I know, Morpheus.
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?
I don't.
I expect just what I've always expected:
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.
He needs all our help.
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.
No.
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.
Yes, Papa.
I am sorry. She is still very curious.
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.
We are most honored to meet you.
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.
It's okay.
I don't have an answer.
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.
It is between your world and our world.
- Who's the Trainman?
