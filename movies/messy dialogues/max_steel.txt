Max Steel (2016) Movie Script

Max.
What are you doing up there?
You were the one who wanted a break.
A pause is taking rest. Not from the
roof fall down and break your neck.
Your father was always there, I was crazy.
Are you here sometimes at night gone?
You were eight weeks old,
I had my hands pretty full.
We have to give it back again.
Tomorrow is the boy of the cable,
in the end we still get internet.
We're home, Max.
If you say so.
We're not going to move anymore.
Here we stay.
Of course. For the ninth time.
Eight. I mean it this time. Promised.
Wait, you feel warm.
- Really?
Sorry, I forgot, what do you think...
a new beginning.
Yes, restart nummertje nine.
I can still cancel the Internet.
Max, get the boxes out.
Your father overdid it
a bit with those stars.
I thought he did not
have enough hanged.
Are you okay?
Is that what happened?
Yes.
Now I also have to call an electrician.
Go to bed on time.
Tomorrow is your first day of school.

The bacon does not eat himself.
You hungry, I...
- I'm good.
See you tonight.
To add binding energy...
they developed a strategy known as:
mental amalgamation.
In order to do so, requires that
not only intensive concentration...
YOU CAN BETTER AT SCHOOL ARE
I again.
They knew that one unit can
not produce enough energy.
Do not be dead.
Are you okay?
- Yes.
Are you sure?
What?
- Are you okay?
Yes, I do this every year.
You're upside down.
Sofia, hurry.
Meet me after school.
Then I look at your bike.

And turn the sound on.
We have a new student.
Mr. McGrath. Max McGrath.
I'm here.
You're not the son of Jim McGrath?
Actually.
A special man.
Where should I sit?
This semester we learn
about harmonic frequencies.
Is everything alright?
- Yes I...
Thank you.

perpetuates THE LIFE OF A GOOD MAN
Throw your bike in the back.
Nice car.
- Thanks.
I've fixed it up with my father.
- Really?
Do not look so surprised.
Maybe I'm offended.
What do I know? I cycle.
You gave her a name, right?
As good as new.
Thank you.
- No problem.
That's strange.
And certainly not my station.
Next time I try not to drive in the way.
Sorry.
- See you later, Max McGrath.
Charlie Quinn. He was our intern. Nice boy.
He always gave us at 02:00 at night coffee.
So what happened every night.
I'm sure...
Hello Sweetie.
- Hi.
Look at you sometimes.
You know Miles, do not you?
Of course.
No.
- He can not remember.
I'm the one who always sent Christmas gifts.
Of course. Miles.
- He remembers it.
You worked with my father.
- Indeed.
Miles eat with us, so go freshen up.
It's 4-0. Here we go again.
I stand for.
What was that?
We put the power shelf in an area of 40 km.
What?
- It was not as large area.
40 kilometers.
- That is amazing.
The police do not think so.
But your father...
could always talk to. He calmed them.
Your father was very special.
It glows.
- That has not been done for 16 years.
you have all the time to contact?
- We now meet for the first time.
Miles was the one who
convinced me to go home.
Really? So this is your fault?
- Totally my fault.
This is amazing.
- No, Smith, do not.
Lee, call security.
Security, we have a problem.
The subject does not sleep anymore.
Today was Max's first day at school.
- Really? How did it go?
Well, more bruises than usual.
active protection shield.
Stay low.
Above the bridge.
Sit quietly on that chair.
You're still broken.
Thank you.
Open it.
- Watch the door.
Keep it close.
We got it.
It comes from the infection chamber.
What did you do for N-Tek?
Paperwork.
Your father was the visionary. Not me.
N-Tek Miles has built up again.
He is now in charge.
Our facility is very different
now than when Jim was there.
Behind you.
- He is approaching.
He's one floor below.
But everything we do is based
on your father's vision.
Your father wanted to save the world.
We just follow his example.
Do not let him get away.
He was about to make a breakthrough.
What happened?
- Let's not talk about that.
It's okay, we can talk about it.
What?
Miles was in the accident.
He was trying to save your father.
Make sure you're not in the water.
THE KEY TO SURVIVAL
SURVIVING A HURRICANE
No, I do not have to tell him.
It's not time yet.
He's not a kid anymore.
- That he is.
You'll be pleased to know
that we have plenty of ham.
Thank goodness.
- We love ham.
It never spoils.
What have I missed?
- The dessert.
Can I bring something from the kitchen?
If you want to come by the office
and see what created your father...
then the door is always open.
- Thank you.
I must say you look a lot like your father.
But much longer.
- Much longer.
But you have his enthusiasm,
that's important.
Good night.
- Bye.
Is everything alright?
I am going to bed.

Come on.
Come on. What?
What the hell?
No.

Max, do you have something connected?
Good.
Well, are you ready?
To.
This is amazing.
Off.

I do not hear what you say.

Do you know where that is?

WHAT AM I?
You are tonight in the woods.
Yet found anything good?
I have not just found something.
I found cute baby pictures of you.
I list the most embarrassing
and hang them everywhere.
Thank you, that's an honor.
What can I say?
They are in the basement likely safer.
Your father was well prepared.
- For what? The zombie apocalypse?
I heard you talk to Miles.
Why does everyone in this town
more about my father than I?
What do you mean?
I talk so often about your father.
No, you do not.
I know nothing about his past,
because you never talk about.
I know nothing about his job, family or...
Or how he died.
Listen...
I want you to know your father.
I recognize a lot of him in you.
He was a great man.
But his story is very complicated.
I do not know if you...
Or am I what?
're ready.
Hey? Mom?
- Sorry.
Hi.
- You found it.
Sorry I'm late. My phone is empty.
It's okay.
What is this?
- Bubba.
What?
- Taste it.
I must warn you, it tastes a little strange.
You get used to it.
No?
- It's very delicious. Thank you.
It's really delicious.
- No problem.
Freda.
- What?
I named my car Freda.
Freda...
- Yes, and this is confidential information.
Of course, no worries.
Your secret's safe with me.
Good thing. For I know your secret.
I know what you're trying to hide.
You have not joined any groups.
But you're at all friendly.
You draw little attention, but enough talk.
So that people will not find it strange.
You're good at being alone.
Without being a loner.
Put your number in my phone.
Then I can again give a tour.
- Maybe.
That you'd do better.
I think your phone is empty.
I was charged.
I have to go quickly to the toilet.
No.
Off.
My God.
I have to go. Sorry.
What?
Max, time to wake up.
Mom.
Mom.
Stay there. Stay away from me.
I'm warning you, stay there.
No, stop. I said stay away from me.
Max.
- What?
You said my name. What did you just say?
Max.
- Is everything well there ?
Max.
- What do you want?
Put your weapon down, Max. Stay calm.
You speak English.
What are you? A kind of robot?
I am a parasitic, silicon based life form.
My name is...
Wait a second. It rhymes with something...
I know. Akstel.
Steel. He called me Steel.
- Who?
I do not know anymore.
But the important thing is:
Where are you from?
-... I found you.
Good question. I am coming...
Are you from the area?
- I think so.
Are you an alien?
- Yes.
And you're Max McGrath.
I am here to protect you from
everything that wants to kill us.
This is madness.
- You have a lot of energy waves.
Chronometer, clock, alarm clock.
- Energy Waves?
Cartography. Map.
- Wait, Steel.
What is this?
- What do you know about my energy?
Stop.
- What is this?
Stop. Steel.
- Yes, Max?
Max, what are you doing?
My mother is coming. You must hide.
Is 'my mother' dangerous?
No. Hurry up.
Cold hands.
Dear, you really need to clean up here.
Max.
What is it?
Are you okay? What was all that screaming?
- Everything is OK.
I had a nightmare, fell out of the bed.
You were yesterday almost unconscious.
You were asleep when I got home.
Are you okay?
I am fine. Growing pains.
What's that sound?
Nothing. My game is still on.
I need to do your laundry.
- No.
From now on, I can do that myself.
You're sometimes really weird.
You'll be late.
I also dreamed, Max.
There were explosions and...
I do it.
What are you doing? Get off me.
Why did you do that?
There energy was released. I absorbed it.
You're welcome.
I'll take you back to
where you found me and...
then you can call home.
Max, you generate the tachyon energy for
the rest of your life and that's all I eat.
Without I would starve.
After you...
- After I what?
Explodes. So we are together forever.
I now know everything you know.
The energy. The Tachyon. Start with that.
- Sounds good.
Where does it come from?
- I pass.
Have you done this to me?
- No, I think you know me.
You woke me up.
Will this kill me?
- Yes, if I'm not there.
You do not understand how lucky
you were that I was yesterday...
to get rid of excess energy
because you nearly explode.
Thanks. I understand.
Are you sometimes a space vampire?
Learn your room mate. Pay attention.
Sorry, Max. Why are we hiding?
Because you're an alien.
They want to dissect or something.
Parsing: In a deceased person
cut for an investigation.
That does not sound logical.
For I am not dead.
Well done, Max. Look at this.
If we link to each other...
- No.
It's okay, they did not see us.
Stop shooting.
Spread. Find it.
Who are those guys?
They fired real bullets at us.
They seemed angry.
Who wants to kill you?
- They want to kill us, Max.
You must surely remember.
I do not know.
I've told you everything I know.
Wait, I remember something else.
Ultra Left approaching us.
What was that?
No idea, I saw it too.
I was in a building.
It seemed like I remembered it,
but I saw you.
I saw a reflection of you.
I was you.
It was your memory. Why did I see that?
I told you. We are connected.
I think you do not listen to me.
I heard a voice say something about...
Ultra Left. Is that what you are?
Ultra Left? No, Max.
Those are very dangerous.
They destroy worlds.
They destroy everything.
They are coming. We have to leave.
I can not go home.
- Because you're afraid of my mother .
No, because men with guns chasing us.
And because you're scaring her.
- Max, that's mean.
We need to go somewhere where
they do not shoot at us.
I can not believe I'm doing this.
You can not do that.
- You just friendly.
Nobody can see you.
Do you remember dissect it?
I remember.
- You have to be cool. Understood?
Yes,
but I have no control over my temperature.
I still ended up in prison.
- If I'm with you.
The integrated measuring point
A to point B on the curve.
Write this well, this will get your exam.
The equation are lies, Max.
That creature does not know what she says.
Do not trust her.
My iPod was still on.
Not true. Do not lie.
What are you, crazy?
We are attacked.
What did you say to me?
I said that my bag is very heavy.
Stupid books. Do not you think so?
Freak.
You see, Max. I protected you. Oh, incoming.
Max?
- Sofia.
What happened yesterday with you?
Are you okay?
Yes. Sorry I ran.
My head felt like it was going to explode.
It was on the Bubba, right?
I do not want you think I'll just let down.
Maybe I can make it up to you?
How are you going to do that?
This is boring.
Are you sure it is?
- It's very close.
Maybe we can talk about this later,
I'm in a hurry.
I'm late for my zumbales.
The girl causes increased
heart rate and breathing.
Perhaps you should avoid it.
Shut up.
- See. It makes you angry.
Here we should be safe.
I do not know, Max.
It seems like that girl...
an exchange controlling
virus have unleashed on you.
We should probably kill her.
- No.
Her name is Sofia anyway. She's...
She is a five horn.
She is a...
A war machine, a snail.
An alien. No, that's me.
She's not dangerous.
That remains to be seen.
What we will do, Steel?
We can not stay here all day.
Maybe my mother help.
You say she is an ally.
No, she's crazy.
My whole life she cares about my health.
Took me to doctors. If they know what...
Mealtime.
Stop that.
- It's okay.
No, I do not stop with it.
If you get excited, you generate energy.
My mother makes you clearly upset.
No, she's just...
It just sucks.
- What?
After what happened to my father.
we just kept moving.
I know. I understand.
What is it?
- Why am I telling you this?
Because I'm here for you, Max.
I'm here to protect you.
Which means you can tell me anything.
Max?
Sometimes I wish my father was alive.
I can talk to him or...
Knowing how his laugh sounded.
I do not know him, but I miss him.
I understand.
I do not know where my home, but I miss it.
Right.
Sorry.
It's okay. I have to stay with you.
It would be helpful if we
know who wants you dead.
US.
- You.
If you can remember something,
I do not know...
perhaps more of that memory that we saw,
it might help us.
Max, look.
This? Do you remember N-Tek?
They attacked us. They're coming for us.
The guests in the black car?
No, the ultra left. They always come to us.
Come on.
Forbidden access.
- Are you serious?
All in capitals. Seems to me very seriously.
Max, wait. Alright.
If you remember any details,
how we activate than memory?
Leave something in this
environment you remember anything?
Yes.
- What?
No,
you go and I. I thought you had something.
Stalk, come on.
Do not move. I'm coming.
Keep now agree on this.
I think I'll keep doing it.
How did you do that?
- Not me. We did.
I say all that as we work together to
harmonize the tachyon energy, so it...
turbo-energy becomes.
Turbo? Really?
Yes, it's very powerful.
The energy can strengthen bodily functions.
How?
- Try to move.
That's funny, but then quickly.
Did you see that? That was fantastic.
Not bad. Try something else.
That's impressive.
But, Max, you know what's even more amazing?
My knowledge of fighting strategy.
I have instilled entire volumes...
You can not be serious.
- Later we're talking about the strategy.
Concentrate.
We can try this again later.
That was an exercise.
We do it again and pay attention to landing.
Very nice.
I have often slightly bloated, but not so.
We're a team. The following...
- For sure I do not die?
About, but the next...
You have the most beautiful not yet seen.
Pretty cool, huh?
- This is all so...
I got you.
That feels good.
- Steel, what happens?
If we tune energy, we create weapons.
- Steel, help me.
Just relax.
- Relax?
Steel, stop the Ultra Left.
I activate the cooler.
Understood.
- If they are in range, then fire.
ULTRA LINKS DETECTED
- How do they get there so fast through? Mk'rah.
That was my father.
You knew my father.
- I think so.
How do you know my father?
- I do not know.
The tornado was definitely
on the night he died?
It was not a normal tornado,
Max, but an Ultra Link.
Everything looks different.
Was to see if I remembered something.
I'm coming. All safe, no ultra Left.
Well, look, I'm in the kitchen.
This is the voice of Molly McGrath.
What do we do now?
TO THE STORE. MAM.
Miles Edwards. N-TEK.
- Miles.
He was there that night.
We're going to talk to Miles.
My father, apparently not a scientist,
knew you, an alien, which is weird...
and you are attacked by
a wind monster thing...
Actually, it's pretty scary, Max.
Ultra-Left control elements: air, wind, fire.
They can control air to create or storms
tornadoes, which is a kind of storm...
So my father has a kind...
Sofia.
We can always kill her.
- You must be still.
Want me over you drive?
- We want you to go.
Should I be silent?
- Danger.
What?
- Max, behind us.
I have to go. Sorry.
- You can not be serious.
Max, two cars following us.
We need a plan.
- Time for the suit.
No, we have...
Do you pack anything?
- We have to split up.
Do you care for distraction,
I go to N-Tek and locate Miles.
I have to protect you.
- Care for some time.
And my knowledge of combat strategy? In such a
situation, for example... It you do not care.
To all units, we are turned off.
I want to yell at you.
- Not a good time.
I'm nice to you, but you're avoiding me.
- It is rather complicated and I...
Come with me.
- What?
I'm lost and do not know which side...
- Where to?
It is called N-Tek and nearby...
- It's 30 km. Do you bike?
Good point. We take the car.
Please.
Get in.
Is everything really okay?
Sure.
Long story.
What happened?
My father died when I was young.
I thought coming back was not bad, but...
I was wrong.
Rotten for you.
All right.
I need a name for my bike.
Any tips?
I'd go for child friendly.
- Family friendly? Really?
Because the toy?
- Those are your words.
But it's true.
Okay.
The next time we go out, we take the bike.
A luxury ride becomes. Really.
The next time we go out?
Max.
- Miles.
I did not know if you would accept my offer.
This is Sofia and sit with me at school.
Hi, Sofia, how is it?
Miles Edwards, your tour guide.
This is amazing.
- Thank you.
We try to develop the work of Max's father.
When I met Jim 20 years ago,
his energy was infectious. Inspiring.
I feel honored to have had him as a partner,
though it was short.
Can I speak to you here somewhere?
- Of course, there. Sit down.
I have only one question, actually.
Sit down.
- No, I want some more about my father.
What happened on the night he died?
- Max...
That's not me.
- Please, Miles. I need to know.
When I arrived, he was already dead and...
Your father... how I spelled this correctly?
Let me show you something. See this?
What is that?
- A small prototype of a power core.
It can control energy in a
way that man has never seen.
This was your father's dream.
- What happened?
Your father was a good friend and
a true scientist, but sometimes...
He did things he thought.
Energy where he played with.
- Wait.
Are you saying that the
accident was his fault?
No, sometimes we try to go beyond,
we actually can handle.
How are you?
Quiet breathing. Come on.
Max?
- Get some water for him.
I have to go.
- Max.
He has a habit of doing that.
You can go after him better.
Dad?
You have to get out.
- The car will not start.
You are welcome.
I come, Max.
Steel.
- I told you we should stay together.
I do not see anything.
- That is not true. Wait a second.
Let's see, which is to think here...
- Choose just one out.
This is crazy.
Where is it going? That thing out of my
memory, an Ultra Link. What must we do?
If you see an unknown
enemy is fatal hesitation.
What are you talking about?
That's combat strategy,
because we have not much tide...
Time.
Never mind.
We have to get out of here.
Faster, Max. Much faster.
What happened with the suit?
The blow deharmoniseerde us.
- Why?
We must work together, Max.
- Get down.
You missed.
- Thanks for reporting that moment.
Max, hold on.
- Steel, help me.
I got you.
There, Max, that's the Ultra Link.
He is now shooting vulnerable.
Use your turbo.
Quick, rebuilds the wind for the weather.
Concentrating. And fire.
We need a stronger sense.
- Really? I think it's good.
What is that?
- I'm not sure.
That's you? Why is that you?
Steel, stop the Ultra Left. I activate the cooler.
- Understood.
What have you done?
You have changed the nuclear force.
Steel, please.
I trusted you. No.
You're one of them, an Ultra Link.
Actually, I'm not like them.
- I can not trust you.
The Ultra Left want to destroy the
Earth and your energy can destroy them.
That was my father, and you killed him.
- No, Max. I helped your father.
We fought together against the
ultra left and we must do the same.
I can not fight against wind
samples and talking to aliens.
Well. Your father would want...
- Who's dead. Do you understand?
I have no one, am alone.
- You're not Max.
Leave me alone.
Mom.
He's there.
McGrath, stop.
Sofia.
Are you insane. Be quiet and...
What happened? Have you had an accident?
Yes. Actually, no, but...
- I'm taking you to the hospital.
Come on in.
- I do not have time. I need your help.
You act strangely.
- Sofia.
I promise I will tell everything.
But now people, I care problems.
How can I help?
I need a phone, your car...
and rubber gloves.
Miles, Max. They are my mother and do
not know where they are taking her...
Max, take it easy. Who is your mother?
- Guests with weapons. They were after me and...
It's happening again.
- What is happening?
The storm tonight was an Ultra Link, huh?
- That you know of?
Listen to me, Max.
The people who have your mother want you.
It's a trap.
I do not get it. Where is she?
Almost certainly the old lab of your father.
The old N-Tek.
Listen carefully,
it's important that we...
No, come on.
Mom?
Mom?
PRIVATE NUMBER
Max, where are you?
- Hey. Ms. McGrath?
Sofia, a friend of Max. Is he home?
No, Sofia. Do you know where he is?
He came to see me and
borrowed my phone and car...
but he did odd when we were at
Dr. were Edwards. He ran outside.
Ms. McGrath, are you okay?
Everything is good, Sofia.
I will call you back.
Miles Edwards has ordered you to kill Steel?
Yes Madam.
That is not logical. Except...
I still have the majority in N-Tek.
So you are now taking orders from me,
understand?
Yes Madam.
- Beautiful.
Find my son.
Steel?
Steel.
granted.
Steel and I have seen this before.
They are explorers.
How much?
- Piece or six, if we're lucky.
Quickly. We have not much time.
The storm cells form itself.
These ultra left as he?
- No, they are not as Steel.
Risking his life, just like us.
- The wind is picking up .
You're not ready, Jim.
- That we are.
How long have we waited for this moment?
The machine will work.
We can put them together.
It blows a strong wind in the outer rim.
Steal the Ultra Left will stop
while I start up the nuclear force.
Understood McGrath.
The wind is now 140 mph.
- If they are within range, Miles, then fire.
Here we go again, Steel.
- We can shoot in 20 seconds.
Two major tornadoes have reached the ground.
Are you ready, Akstel?
- Always.
Weapons are charged.
The Ultra Left come closer. They went
through the outside, but the room holds.
We have not much time. Quickly, Mk'rah.
- How do they get there so fast through?
There is something wrong.
The outer line is broken.
Steel.
Miles, beware.
Behind you.
You work with them.
Miles, what are you doing?
Steel.
- Miles, please.
They call you a rebel. Do you know?
Miles, listen.
- Let's take a walk.
I chose the wrong partner, Jim.
- Why do you do this, Miles?
You do not know what they are.
They will destroy everything.
I made a deal.
I kill you, and may I have your energy.
I trusted you.
- You trusted him.
You weaken the defense.
You have changed the nuclear force.
- I'll suck you. Each piece.
Mk'rah.
- Steel.
I can loosen you Mk'rah.
- Steel, listen to me.
I'm going to overload the core.
- No.
If you go into stasis, you survive the blow.
When you wake up, go to Max.
Find him...
- Dad.
protect him...
more does not matter.
You make it so easy for me.
In the beginning I did not know if you could
generate energy. Until that monster awoke.
Your father convinced Steel to
rebel against the ultra Left.
His own race.
Thank you. I was waiting for.
When I worked with your father and
the machine, I was exposed to it.
Little by little I made a suit that
absorbed the energy, as do the ultra Left.
You wanted the Ultralink killed me.
- You are dead? I need you alive.
You're my source Tachyon Energy.
Step now obediently within the core
and continue where stopped your father.
You were his friend.
Your father was an alien, Max.
You have slain him.
- Not so dramatic, halfbloedje.
Think you, just like your father,
you are a warrior? Not really.
You are alone and can not win.
Step into the core.
Step into the core.
- Okay.
I'm sorry, Steel.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Your father called Mk'rah and was my friend.
We chose to protect the earth together.
What are you doing?
That's too much energy.
You were wrong. I am not alone.
- This is impossible.
Now, Steel.
He trusted you.
- We trusted you.
You have made a mistake.
Want power? Come and get it.
It's over, Max.
- Come on, Max. Get up.
Maxy, you can not deny that it feels good.
Max, we need to avoid its claws.
It takes energy and weakens us.
As far as I was. Now what?
Stealth mode.
- Do we have it?
Do you think you are a hero
by your transformation?
You do not get.
Away from the boy.
Harkins.
Everybody get out.
He's too strong. What must we do?
- I remember now, Max.
Our little Max. He is handsome.
Son worthy of his old block.
But...
how will he be?
He is what he wants to be.
We're not going away.
We go back.
- Yes.
We need a plan.
- Battle Strategy: Thirst drown easily.
Come out, Max.
- Is that it?
That is it.
- What is what?
Give him what he wants.
- Really? Oh, that's pretty smart.
No one's coming to save you. Show yourself.
- Steel, we survive?
No idea, Max.
There you are. You can think or die.
I chose to think, your father's death.
And you, Max?
I have more in common with
my father than I thought.
You're as arrogant as your father.
If you want the power, then pick it.
Steel, now, to turbo.
- Do I, Max.
Idiot, you give me exactly what I need.
Sure?
When too much energy I seem to explode.
This is for my father.
Steel.
Stalk, come on.
Please.
Everything should be good.
I can not lose you.
You see, Max? We have fun together.
The armament still feels strange.
That's okay. We are actually Matroesjka's.
Secure. Over there.
- What now? Can you stand up?
No. Do you?
No.
D-06, secure everything.
- What must we do?
Hope they are friendly.
- Max?
Mom?
- Be careful, please.
I want you to meet someone.
Steel, you're alive.
- Hi, Molly.
We have much to discuss.
You're really married to an alien.
- What is wrong with that?
When your father died,
I did not know what to do.
Everyone thought it was an accident,
something vague.
I knew that the ultra left were
behind them and behind you.
So I did that I thought would protect you:
I fled.
New cities, new doctors...
I did not know if you
would explode or something.
I should have told you when
I thought you were too young.
I suspect Miles really.
- I was 16 years in prison, but good.
I'm really sorry, Steel.
If I'd known you were alive,
I had kicked everything upside down.
Miles said we had to go
back to Copper Canyon,
as the energy would
be revealed in you.
I tried to help you.
But that was almost to death.
I have long tried to keep it hidden.
Because I was afraid
you'd be like your father.
But now I can not be proud enough.
What's your name?
Are there any other Ultra Left?
- Yes.
Why else do you think I
look so much at the stars?
Why are they not yet come for me?
No idea.
Maybe because you have not had the strength.
But now they'll come after you.
I thought I could protect you,
but I can not.
Therefore I do not feel really better.
I do know one thing:
you do not have to do this.
I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.
I've been around for too long.
Now it is yours.
I do not understand.
- It'll come.
Steel.
It shows.
He must know where he came
to know who he is from.
Thank you, Dad.
Everything is okay.
Where were you?
Quite a strange story.
- Bring it on.
Listen...
I wanted to let you know
that you like as me.
I'm just used to and I like that.
When I moved here,
I thought it would be like always.
Until you showed up.
Thanks for seeing me.
What is this?
- Open it.
We have much to discuss.
Yeah, maybe we can...
doing tour, you were talking about.
What you did tonight?
- Only if you can.
I'm never.
See you later, Max McGrath.
Maybe good that we have not slain her.
- Are you serious?
Airplane mode?
- Airplane mode.
The suit is to me tighter.
- We'll fly you and nags?
To the right.
- No, left.
No, right.
- The other right?
Then straight ahead.
- Okay.
