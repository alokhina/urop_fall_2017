E  |||  
C  |||  BLACKNESS
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
N  |||  printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
N  |||  center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
N  |||  simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
N  |||  the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
N  |||  speaking.
E  |||  
C  |||  VOICE
D  |||  As astonishing advances in computer
D  |||  science are made, artificial intelligence
D  |||  programs are being designed to assist
D  |||  us in every area of life...
E  |||  
N  |||  We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
N  |||  wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
N  |||  intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
N  |||  the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.
E  |||  
C  |||  VOICE (CONT.)
D  |||  In a world-wide network of electronics,
D  |||  they travel through miles of circuitry
D  |||  at the speed of light. We created them to
D  |||  calculate and research, to help us design
D  |||  and heal and think. With all that they can
D  |||  do, are they only electrical impulses...
D  |||  or are they a new form of life?
E  |||  
N  |||  The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
N  |||  us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
N  |||  programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
N  |||  towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
N  |||  As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
N  |||  on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
N  |||  a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
N  |||  the screen in huge letters.
E  |||  
M  |||  T R O N ! !
E  |||  
N  |||  The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
N  |||  become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
N  |||  if it had an inner core of electricity.
E  |||  
N  |||  The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
N  |||  OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
N  |||  ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
N  |||  electronic information in our computers, television sets and
N  |||  telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
N  |||  data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
N  |||  time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
N  |||  the window of television screens.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
N  |||  dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
N  |||  SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
N  |||  encasing them.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
N  |||  trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
N  |||  other.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
N  |||  as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
N  |||  their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
N  |||  electronic beeping and popping.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
N  |||  landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
N  |||  reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
N  |||  like a crack of lightning.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
N  |||  Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
N  |||  maze.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
N  |||  glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
N  |||  one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
N  |||  warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
N  |||  throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
N  |||  glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
N  |||  down, LAUGHING.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
N  |||  Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
N  |||  on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
N  |||  at each other.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
N  |||  mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
N  |||  the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
N  |||  yellow.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
N  |||  back with violent force.
E  |||  
M  |||  16A THE SMALLER WARRIOR 16A
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
N  |||  into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
N  |||  last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
N  |||  face as he falls to instant death.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
N  |||  glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:
E  |||  
M  |||  "WINNER: BLUE - SARK!!"
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  BOY'S VOICE
M  |||  (distant, echoing)
M  |||  Aagh! God, Lisa, I almost had you that
M  |||  time.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  DISSOLVE TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we
N  |||  can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is
N  |||  prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM."
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BOY
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Lemme play you again?
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  TEENAGE GIRL
M  |||  (holds out a hand)
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Yeah, if you've got another quarter.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  FOCUS ON SCREEN, ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY AND
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  DISSOLVE TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
N  |||  looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
N  |||  walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
N  |||  Sark comes in and one of them calls out:
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  WARRIOR 1
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark, my man! You are hot!
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  WARRIOR 2
M  |||  That knuckleball gets 'em every
M  |||  time, boy...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY, and Sark moves on.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  overlooking the video game grid. We see Sark walking onto the bridge,
N  |||  removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
N  |||  sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
N  |||  satisfaction.
E  |||  
N  |||  The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
N  |||  cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
N  |||  solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
N  |||  hidden from view.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of this happening. We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
N  |||  ... a wavering image of a stretched out face, just features,
N  |||  appears superimposed on the cylinder. The face speaks.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  VOICE (MCP)
M  |||  You're getting brutal, Sark.
M  |||  Brutal and needlessly sadistic.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
N  |||  a drug addict, eyes glazed.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Thank. you, Master Control.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  We might be capturing some military
D  |||  programs soon... that interest you?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these
D  |||  guys ... be a nice break from these
D  |||  accounting creampuffs you keep sending
D  |||  me. Which branch of the service?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Strategic Air Command.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  SARK (impressed)
N  |||  Nice.
E  |||  
N  |||  The sockets glow 'more intensely as the hologram disappears, and we
N  |||  CUT FROM a CLOSE SHOT of Sark's satiated face to:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  long, darkened, sinister. A dejected and disheveled character
N  |||  (CROM) is being escorted by a guard..
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CAPTIVE (CROM)
M  |||  Look, this is all a mistake. I'm just
M  |||  a compound interest program, I work
M  |||  at a savings and loan. I can't play
M  |||  in these video games...
E  |||  
C  |||  GUARD
D  |||  Sure you can, pal. You're a natural
D  |||  athlete, I ever saw one. Come on...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  Are you kidding? Me? I run out to
D  |||  check an the T-Bill rates, I get out
D  |||  of breath. Hey, really...you're
D  |||  gonna make my User, Mr. Henderson,
D  |||  really mad. He's a full branch manager...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GUARD
D  |||  (rolls his eyes)
D  |||  Great, another religious nut.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They stop in front of a cell, the guard opens the door and shoves the
N  |||  protesting captive inside. The door SLAMS shut, locked.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the captive falls against one wall from the force of the guard's
N  |||  shove. The cell is small, one-man, and in each wall next to the door,
N  |||  an opening gives a view of the next cell. Through one of the windows,
N  |||  we can see the back of another captive program, and through the
N  |||  other, a face looking over at the newcomer. The character speaks:
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  PROGRAM (RAM)
M  |||  Welcome to luxury living.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The new captive looks up, nervous.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  Uh, thanks, but... I don't even know
D  |||  what I'm doing here.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  You believe in the Users?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  Sure, if I don't have a User, then
D  |||  who wrote me?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  That's what you're doing here. Master
D  |||  Control Program's been snapping up
D  |||  all us programs who believe...if he
D  |||  thinks you're useful, he takes over
D  |||  all your functions so he gets bigger...
D  |||  an' if he can't use you, he sends you
D  |||  down here to the Game Grid to get the
D  |||  bits blasted outta you. What's your name?
E  |||

D  |||  Crom.

C  |||  RAM
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  I'm Ram. They'll train you for
N  |||  the games, but ... well, I hope you
N  |||  make it okay. Hey, what's going on
N  |||  in the other sectors? I've been stuck
N  |||  in this Grid for 200 microcycles.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He points to several hash marks on his cell wall.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  It's murder out there. You can't even
D  |||  travel around your own microcircuits
D  |||  without permission from that Master
D  |||  Control creep. Hauling me down here to
D  |||  play games...who does he calculate he is?
E  |||  
N  |||  (holds his head in his hands)
N  |||  If only Tron was still around...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange,
N  |||  still expression on his face.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  You ever see that guy in action?
D  |||  Hundred-percent independent. MCP
D  |||  couldn't tell him what to --
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  What's wrong? What did I say?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.

E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  Oh my User...Tron--they've got
D  |||  you in here?
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring.

E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
N  |||  one of the paths.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
N  |||  and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
N  |||  coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck
N  |||  driver on an all-night run.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CLU
D  |||  Think we can merge into this mem'ry
D  |||  okay, good buddy?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
N  |||  into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
N  |||  it speaks.

D  |||  "tower" -- an input/output component.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits
N  |||  up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next
N  |||  to his head.

N  |||  We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the
N  |||  keys.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
N  |||  distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
N  |||  U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
N  |||  a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.
E  |||  
E  |||

E  |||  
N  |||  FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
N  |||  ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
N  |||  the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
N  |||  The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
N  |||  from the tank, fast.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
N  |||  Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
N  |||  see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
N  |||  up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.

E  |||  
C  |||  GUARD
D  |||  Came into the system with a stolen
D  |||  password ... an' we caught him
D  |||  tryin' to raid a high-clearance
D  |||  memory.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CLU
D  |||  (looks up, his face
D  |||  wracked with pain)
D  |||  No...I must've gotten in there
D  |||  by mistake, I -
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
N  |||  momentarily becomes unbearable.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Who programmed you?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP (CONT.)
D  |||  You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
D  |||  But if you tell us who put you up
D  |||  to it, you could make it easy on
D  |||  yourself. Come on, who's your user?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CLU
D  |||  Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty
D  |||  Master Control ... you're not
D  |||  makin' me talk.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Suit yourself ...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
N  |||  doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
N  |||  pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
N  |||  electric static.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Get me Dillinger.

E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  HELICOPTER
E  |||  
N  |||  We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
N  |||  vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
N  |||  impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
N  |||  scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
N  |||  party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
N  |||  up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:
E  |||  
M  |||  DILLINGER (O.S.)
M  |||  Hello?
M  |||  A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
M  |||  Mr. Dillinger?
M  |||  DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
M  |||  Yes.
M  |||  A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
M  |||  Hello, please hold a moment for the
M  |||  Master Control Program
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
N  |||  focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
N  |||  an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
N  |||  approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
N  |||  accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
N  |||  increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
N  |||  sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
N  |||  landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
N  |||  CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
N  |||  a passenger.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  PILOT'S VOICE
M  |||  will you be around for a while, or
M  |||  are you going right back out?
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  DILLINGER'S VOICE
M  |||  Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
M  |||  got some things to take care of.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
N  |||  off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
N  |||  In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
N  |||  across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter
N  |||  approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  on top of the building. Several technicians are at hand, and as the
N  |||  helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
N  |||  suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
N  |||  entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
N  |||  fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
N  |||  printed out on the screen:
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
N  |||  Password: MASTER.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
N  |||  addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
N  |||  through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
N  |||  its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
N  |||  that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
N  |||  compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Hello, Ed. Thanks for coming back early.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Dillinger settles into a chair.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  No problem, Master-C. If you've seen
D  |||  one Consumer Electronics Show... (shrugs)
D  |||  What's up?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  It's our friend the boy detective.
D  |||  He's nosing around again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Flynn?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Yes. It felt like Flynn.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  He's still looking for that old file...
D  |||  can't you just appropriate it?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  I would if I could find it. it's stashed
D  |||  somewhere off in the system ...
D  |||  out of my range. Meanwhile...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Meanwhile, he might find it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time
D  |||  and kicked him out, but he's getting
D  |||  trickier all the time.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  I think we'd better shut off all
D  |||  access till we can find that file.
D  |||  Just to be safe.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  There's a 68.71 percent chance
D  |||  you're right.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Cute.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP

E  |||  
N  |||  CLOSE SHOT of a very messy desk, with a coffee cup and half an egg
N  |||  salad sandwich lying on top of the computer console, with fingers
N  |||  visible typing on the keyboard.

N  |||  of ALAN BAILEY blearily looking at the screen; he's a serious-
N  |||  looking man in his early thirties, wearing wire-rimmed glasses, and
N  |||  he looks like he hasn't slept for a week. On top of the terminal is
N  |||  a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient
N  |||  popcorn maker and a bottle of Crisco Oil. Pinned to one wall is
N  |||  a small sign reading, "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto!" Alan types into
N  |||  the touch keyboard:
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SCREEN
D  |||  REQUEST: access to the TRON program,
D  |||  User code 717 - Bailey.
D  |||  Password: FREEDOM.
E  |||

N  |||  He starts to type again, but the screen clears and:

E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  (surprised)
D  |||  Huh...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He pushes his chair back, leaves his office.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Dillinger opens the door, welcoming Alan.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Come on in...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Alan. Alan Bailey.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud
D  |||  seeding...great piece of work.
D  |||  How's it going?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He waves Alan to a chair; they sit.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Well, I don't know...I just tried
D  |||  to run this program I've been working
D  |||  on, and I was denied access all of
D  |||  a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been
D  |||  laid off and nobody told me.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Yeah...?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  We have to close that down, just
D  |||  briefly. Security reasons. Someone
D  |||  with that access has been tampering.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  I hope you don't think it's me.
D  |||  I don't even balance my checkbook on
D  |||  downtime. I've got a Honeywell at
D  |||  home for that.
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand.
D  |||  It should only be a couple of days.
D  |||  What's the thing you're working on?
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  It's called Tron. It's a security
D  |||  program itself, actually. Monitors
D  |||  all the contacts between our system
D  |||  and other systems... If it finds
D  |||  anything going on that's not scheduled,
D  |||  it shuts it down. I sent you a memo
D  |||  on it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  No, it'll run independently.
D  |||  It can watchdog the MCP as well.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have
D  |||  you running again in a couple of days,
D  |||  I hope.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Ok
E  |||  
N  |||  Alan rises, goes to the door. As soon as he leaves:
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  (trouble)
D  |||  Oh boy.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The Master Control Program comes back to life, on the screen and
N  |||  through the speakers.
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  I'm sorry -
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  (sharply)
D  |||  I can't afford to have an independent
D  |||  program monitoring me. Do you have any
D  |||  idea how many outside systems I've gone into?
D  |||  How many programs I've appropriated?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  (nods)
D  |||  It's my fault. I programmed you to want
D  |||  so much...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
D  |||  next week...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  The Pentagon?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  It shouldn't be any harder than General
D  |||  Motors was. But now...this is what I get
D  |||  for using humans.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  What do you want with the Pentagon?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  The same thing I want with the Kremlin.
D  |||  I'm bored with corporations. With the
D  |||  information I can access, I can run things
D  |||  900 to 1200 times better than any human.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  If you think -
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file
D  |||  and read it up on a VDT at the New
D  |||  York Times, would you?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  You wouldn't dare.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program
D  |||  out of the system. And get me those Chinese
D  |||  language program I asked for.
E  |||  
N  |||  End of line.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Alan push open the door under a sign reading "Laser Research."
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass WINDOW through
N  |||  which the laser laboratory is visible. A sign over the window,
N  |||  marked "Experiment in Progress," is illuminated by a red warning
N  |||  bulb.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
N  |||  suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
N  |||  encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
N  |||  picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
N  |||  tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
N  |||  tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
N  |||  getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
N  |||  at them.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
N  |||  with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
N  |||  using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
N  |||  hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
N  |||  wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
N  |||  has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
N  |||  bristling white eyebrows.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
N  |||  defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
N  |||  Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
N  |||  at the moment.
E  |||  
N  |||  As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  (sighs)
D  |||  Well, here goes nothing ...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  Hah. Interesting, interesting. You
D  |||  hear what you said? "Here goes nothing."
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Well, I meant -
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  Whereas actually, what we propose to
D  |||  do is to turn something into nothing
D  |||  and back again. So you might just as
D  |||  well have said, "Here goes something
D  |||  and here comes nothing." Hah?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
N  |||  cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
N  |||  polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
N  |||  laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
N  |||  plat-form -- empty.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Let me make sure we're running
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
N  |||  connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
N  |||  console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
N  |||  the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
N  |||  close enough to watch.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She types a series of commands on the computer keyboard.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Looks good...
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  GIBBS (O.S.)
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Let 'er rip...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
N  |||  sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
N  |||  received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
N  |||  it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
N  |||  the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
N  |||  discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
N  |||  film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
N  |||  five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
N  |||  rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  (quietly)
D  |||  Perfect.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
N  |||  and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
N  |||  shoe-covers, walking toward them.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Beautiful!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  Hello, Alan.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Boy, I sit up there grindin' away
D  |||  all day, and you guys are down here
D  |||  disintegrating things and having fun.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
D  |||  While the laser is dismantling the
D  |||  molecular structure of the object,
D  |||  the computer maps out a holographic
D  |||  model of it. The molecules themselves
D  |||  are suspended in the laser beam. Then
D  |||  the computer reads the model back out,
D  |||  the molecules go back into place, and...
D  |||  (indicates ball)
D  |||  voila.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  Yes...but you have to go roundtrip,
D  |||  and you must purchase your program
D  |||  at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The three start walking out of the laser lab, Alan and Lora with
N  |||  their arms around each other's shoulders.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  How's it going upstairs?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready
D  |||  to run, and Dillinger cut everybody
D  |||  with Group 7 access out of the system.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Gibbs looks alarmed, but doesn't say anything.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  Ever since he got that Master Control
D  |||  Program set up, system's got more bugs
D  |||  than a bait store.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  Well, you have to expect some static.
D  |||  Computers are just machines after all,
D  |||  they can't think...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  They'll start to soon enough.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  (wryly)
D  |||  Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers
D  |||  will start thinking, and people will
D  |||  stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some
D  |||  data through. See you tomorrow.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  AD LIB goodnights.
E  |||  
E  |||

N  |||  outside laser lab where all technicians, etc. have to put on the
N  |||  protective suits, or at least dirt-free shoes. Lora is pulling off
N  |||  her white suit, and Alan pulls white paper protectors off his shoes.
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Did you say Group 7 access?
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Yeah...pain in the neck, you know,
D  |||  I was all set
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Did he say why?
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  Something about tampering. Some body's
D  |||  prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget
D  |||  into his checking account, I don't know.
D  |||  Why are you so interested?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Flynn had Group 7 access.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not
D  |||  interested in talking about him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA

E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  For being on to Dillinger.

N  |||  decorated with huge murals of computer chips and electronic
N  |||  circuitry. We see dozens of individual machines, where scores of
N  |||  GUYS and GIRLS, teenagers mostly, but older and younger kids too,
N  |||  are playing the games, watching, milling around, CHATTERING.
N  |||  As the kids play, colored glows from the video games light up their

N  |||  face, catching the orange glow from the console.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The game has a prominent ICOM logo under the screen. Flynn is a
N  |||  cocky kid in his mid-20s, unshaven, wearing a T-shirt, jeans,
N  |||  jogging shoes. He's racked up a terrific score.
E  |||  
N  |||  Kids are grouped around him, tensely watching the game -- fans.
N  |||  As we watch, the machine's nine-digit scoreboard goes to
N  |||  999,999,999 -- then flashes the word "RECORD" as lights blink and
N  |||  a SIREN sounds. The kids cheer wildly.

D  |||  It's all in the wrist, friends.
E  |||

D  |||  We have to talk.

N  |||  desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw Flynn working in
N  |||  scenes 29, 33, etc.), and a couple of video games -- Flynn's
N  |||  favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
N  |||  noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans
N  |||  against a game, nervous; Lora paces.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (stretching his

D  |||  So...how's the world of serious science?

D  |||  Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a

D  |||  Are you embezzling?
E  |||  
E  |||

D  |||  (Sydney Greenstreet)
D  |||  "Embezzling" is such an ugly word,
D  |||  Mister Bailey...
D  |||  (normal voice)
D  |||  No, actually I'm trying to get a

D  |||  Sherman, set the Wayback Machine
D  |||  for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn
D  |||  (points to himself)
D  |||  is one of the brightest young
D  |||  software engineers at ICOM. He's so
D  |||  bright that he starts going in there
D  |||  at night, and sets up a private memory
D  |||  file, and begins writing a program
D  |||  for a video game he is inventing,
D  |||  called...
D  |||  (waves at one of the
D  |||  games in the room)
D  |||  ...Space Paranoids.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  You invented Space Paranoids?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown...
D  |||  whole slew of 'em. I was this close
D  |||  (gestures)
D  |||  to starting my own little enterprise.
D  |||  But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another
D  |||  software engineer -- not so young,
D  |||  not so bright, but very, very sneaky.
D  |||  One night, our boy Flynn goes to his
D  |||  terminal, tries to read up his file,
D  |||  and ... nothing. A big blank. We now
D  |||  take you to three months later.
D  |||  Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
D  |||  video games he has "invented" -- the
D  |||  slime didn't even change the names --
D  |||  and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus
D  |||  begins his meteoric rise to...what is
D  |||  he now, Executive V.P.?

D  |||  machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  I still don't get why you're trying to
D  |||  break into the system.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Because somewhere... in one of those
D  |||  memories ... is the evidence. If I got in
D  |||  far enough, I could reconstruct it.

D  |||  Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must
D  |||  know what you're up to.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.

E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Dillinger?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it.
D  |||  Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.
D  |||  Just Eddie and his Master Control Program,
D  |||  runnin' things from on high..
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Don't even say that. You've got to find that
D  |||  file before he does..
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just
D  |||  slip it into another system as soon as it
D  |||  locates it...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Not if my Tron program was running. That
D  |||  would seal the system off. If your file's in
D  |||  there...

D  |||  Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge
D  |||  us a Group 6 access...

C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own
D  |||  people can't get access to their
D  |||  programs ... you know how frustrating
D  |||  it is, when you're working on a piece
D  |||  of research -
E  |||

D  |||  Walter, I sympathize, but I have data
D  |||  coming out of the Master Control Program
D  |||  saying there is something screwy --

D  |||  That MCP, you know, that's half the
D  |||  problem right --
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  The MCP is the most efficient way of
D  |||  handling what we do. I can't sit and
D  |||  worry about every little user request that --
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIBBS
D  |||  User requests are what computers are for.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DILLINGER
D  |||  Doing our business is what computers are

D  |||  isn't the business you started in your garage
D  |||  anymore --
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board,
N  |||  and a series of IMAGES appear on the computer's screens: vast
N  |||  computer banks...rows of-magnetic disks...ICOM's globe logo spinning
N  |||  in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
N  |||  millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
N  |||  computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
N  |||  Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth
N  |||  adding up, accounts receivable and assets.

N  |||  The three of them walk along a semi-darkened corridor, trying to

E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA
D  |||  Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at

E  |||  
N  |||  from the camera at the entrance to the laser lab. We see Flynn
N  |||  approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
N  |||  his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
N  |||  camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

E  |||  
N  |||  We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising
N  |||  silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
N  |||  is this section that is being activated.

D  |||  Now, how do you expect to run the

D  |||  problems throw you like that? C'mon,

E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  You're entering a big error, Flynn...
D  |||  I'm going to have to put you on the
D  |||  Game Grid.

E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Games, huh? I'll give you --
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
N  |||  behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
N  |||  freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
N  |||  a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
N  |||  ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
N  |||  being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
N  |||  with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
N  |||  blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and
E  |||  
M  |||  DISSOLVE TO:

N  |||  we saw at the opening of the film'.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
N  |||  rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
N  |||  getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
N  |||  glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
N  |||  covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
N  |||  closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
N  |||  with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
N  |||  angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
N  |||  deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
N  |||  an internal energy.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
N  |||  structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
N  |||  and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
N  |||  everything blurring with the speed.

D  |||  Oh, man... this isn't happening. It only

E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A horrendous, towering character, carrying a long, glowing staff,

D  |||  What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know,

N  |||  voice.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The same type of cell Crom was thrown into in the title sequence.
N  |||  Flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands.

N  |||  Flynn's hands are glowing, electrified.

N  |||  understanding on his face. Voices are coming through the opening
N  |||  of the neighboring cell.

C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hey! Who are you guys?
D  |||  What's the story around here?
E  |||

N  |||  it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
N  |||  come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
N  |||  disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.

E  |||  
E  |||

E  |||  
N  |||  We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's

E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK

E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
N  |||  bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
N  |||  circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
N  |||  marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
N  |||  When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
N  |||  We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
N  |||  and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
N  |||  looks over at Crom, who's anxious.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Looks like we're in the same boat here -
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  CROM
D  |||  (jumpy)
D  |||  You think you're gonna wipe me right
D  |||  out, don't you?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  No, I
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
N  |||  upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
N  |||  straight for Flynn.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
N  |||  his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
N  |||  right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
N  |||  himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  down, down between the rings into an infinite pit.
E  |||  
E  |||

E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hey!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther
N  |||  edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and
N  |||  catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains,
N  |||  but misses. One of his rings disappears.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (happy he's scored)
D  |||  Okay!

N  |||  High above the game we see Sark watching.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  racing for another catch. He makes it and hurls the pellet again.
N  |||  We see that Crom's platform is disappearing fast.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Here's an easy one...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn throws again. The pellet hits the mirror platform and heads
N  |||  straight at Crom, who misses it. The pellet destroys the ring he
N  |||  was standing on, and Crom has to grab frantically at the edge of
N  |||  the next ring to keep from falling.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it
N  |||  ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His face lit from below by the glow of the Game Grid... angry
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He puts down his cesta. Suddenly a voice rings out from above.

C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Kill him!!!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn holds up the pellet... and drops it down into the abyss below.
N  |||  He stares back up at Sark's immense image.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  No!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  in the mirror platform, towering above Flynn.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  You'll regret this.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  pressing a button.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a SCREAM, he
N  |||  falls... and falls ... and falls...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  with Flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of Sark above
N  |||  him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost
N  |||  presses it... We see him-straining, trying to overcome his
N  |||  conditioning. Then he snatches his hand away.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  (looking up)
D  |||  No! You said he could die in the games
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  staring up. The image on the mirror wavers and dissolves.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He SLAMS his palm down on a panel on the console, and a BUZZER
C  |||  SOUNDS.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting
N  |||  to run across to him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells. They look
N  |||  up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn is being escorted down it. A couple of big Blue Warriors go by
N  |||  and deliberately brush into Flynn.
E  |||  
C  |||  WARRIOR
D  |||  (turning on Flynn,
D  |||  snarling)
D  |||  Outta my way, rookie.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
N  |||  and pulls out his disk.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Out of my way, zero bit.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He moves as if to throw the disk.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  WARRIOR
D  |||  (backing away)
D  |||  Sure, sure ... just kiddin'.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as
N  |||  Flynn and his guards continue on.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram and Tron are escorted in as Flynn is brought in from another
N  |||  corridor. Three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (under his breath)
D  |||  Tron...?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He leans over to get a better look at Tron and GASPS in surprise.
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Alan!
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (frowning)
D  |||  Where did you hear that name?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Well, isn't it -- ?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (thinking fast)
D  |||  I, uh... I'm a program from a User
D  |||  that... knows Alan...?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of
D  |||  stuff. Like...my User wants me to go
D  |||  after the MCP
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Before they can go on, the BUZZER sounds.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  floating over the Game Grid, with a view of the light cycle arena.
N  |||  ZOOM IN on the section of the grid where the game is about to start.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
N  |||  sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
N  |||  high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
N  |||  hovering high overhead.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  That's what my User wants, too...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  holding the handlebars of the cycles in front of them. We see Tron
N  |||  and Ram looking at Flynn, in the center.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  I know...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  With a sizzling electrical discharge, the light cycle is inscribed
N  |||  around him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  ready to go.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  also ready.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His finger presses a button and the BUZZER SOUNDS again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see the six solid walls being formed behind the cycles. As we
N  |||  watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
N  |||  and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of the other cycle heading straight at him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
N  |||  turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
N  |||  forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
N  |||  arena.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  FLYNN'S VOICE
M  |||  (into mike)
M  |||  Nice one!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They start making turns, passing walls they have already created,
N  |||  each trying to box the other in.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  TRON'S VOICE
M  |||  (into mike)
M  |||  Ram, stay all the way over ...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  rushing forward.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  turning.
E  |||  
M  |||  RAM'S VOICE
M  |||  (into mike)
M  |||  I've got control. Go ahead.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
N  |||  the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
N  |||  inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
N  |||  There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
N  |||  the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
N  |||  dissolve as he does.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  rushing alongside his opponent. They make a turn.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They make another turn
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  right at the camera.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of the maze of walls. He gets clear for a moment and spots the crack
N  |||  in the bulwark.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  reacting, getting an idea.
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (into mike)
D  |||  You guys...follow me.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  racing together, approaching the bulwark. At the last second, the
N  |||  Blue Warrior turns, but Flynn races right at the crack.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  observing this. With satisfaction. Now he will be rid of the User.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He races straight at the crack... and through it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His face suffused with anger. He SLAMS a fist down on the console
N  |||  in front of him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The remaining four cycles are still racing around the arena.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  reacting to Flynn's escape, hope in his eyes.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  SMASHING another one of the Blue Warriors against a wall. He turns
N  |||  and races up next to Tron.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  side by side. They look at each other.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  (into mike)
D  |||  What do you think?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (into mike)
D  |||  Do it!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see their cycles veer off and head straight for the crack. We
N  |||  HEAR a LOUD SIREN and a mechanical voice starts up:
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  VOICE
D  |||  (through loudspeaker)
D  |||  WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE GAME GRID.
M  |||  REPEAT: ALL WARRIORS MUST STAY WITHIN THE
M  |||  GAME GRID. WARNING. WARNING.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We continue to hear this voice repeating under the escape, gradually
N  |||  diminishing as the three friends get farther away, until it dies
N  |||  out altogether.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  moving towards the dividing bulwark, passing over it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  racing through the narrow crack in the bulwark, barely enough room
N  |||  to get by. They emerge into an open corridor, with the Recognizers
N  |||  appearing overhead. We watch the cycles rush past the CAMERA...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He is pacing across the bridge of the carrier, smashing guards out
N  |||  of his way.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Get them. Send out every Game
D  |||  Tank in the Grid! Get them!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as he looks up and spots the Recognizers hovering over them, about
N  |||  to come down for the kill.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (into mike)
D  |||  Watch it!
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  (into mike)
D  |||  Recognizers!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  heading for a smaller opening in one wall, labeled "Game Storage."
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the three cycles race into the opening. The Reco's are blocked,
N  |||  way too big to fit through the opening.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  FROM FLYNN'S POV as they rush through long narrow rooms filled with
N  |||  rows of tanks and missiles. As they speed past, the rows of tanks
N  |||  REV UP, turn in formation, one after the other, like the Rockettes,
N  |||  and follow.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
N  |||  Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
N  |||  narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
N  |||  ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
N  |||  around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
N  |||  face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.
E  |||  
M  |||  255A ANGLE ON FLYNN 255A
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  listening.
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (into mike)
D  |||  Game Tanks! Come on
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the three cycles rev up and race off, headed for one of the
N  |||  narrow openings in the cliff face, and plunge into it, disappearing
N  |||  from view.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
N  |||  darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a
N  |||  stop and de-rez. Leaving each man standing with just the handlebars
N  |||  between his fists. They all let out a long SIGH and relax.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Oh man...when you're on the other side
D  |||  of the screen...it all looks so easy...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram and Tron look at Flynn as if he's crazy, then start smiling and
N  |||  grinning, until all three are LAUGHING.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the force of tanks RUMBLES through the terrain, the aircraft
N  |||  carrier hovering overhead.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark is staring feverishly out over the barren landscape.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  (to one of the bridge
D  |||  personnel)
D  |||  Get the pursuit force back into 404A.
D  |||  There's no place else they could be...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark's lieutenant is watching the wall-sized screen behind Sark,
N  |||  where we can see a diagram of the area, with the tanks visible,
N  |||  moving through it. He turns to Sark.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LIEUTENANT
D  |||  (confidently)
D  |||  We'll have them in no time, sir. Long
D  |||  before the interrupt interface.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  (whirls on him)
D  |||  We better, null unit. I'll be lucky if
D  |||  the MCP doesn't blast me into a dead zone.
D  |||  I want those programs!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the
N  |||  cave. Beyond them we can see a cluster of structures, like a
N  |||  cityscape, and one enormous TOWER with a golden beam of light rising
N  |||  from it, farther up than the eye can see. No tanks are visible.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (looking out)
D  |||  It's all circuits...
D  |||  (points at tower)
D  |||  Must be an input/output component...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you
D  |||  remembered anything else about
D  |||  yourself -- like what sector you're
D  |||  from?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (sitting down
D  |||  against a rock)
D  |||  Well...my home "sector" was called
D  |||  Paramus ...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  (sits also)
D  |||  PARAMUS... wonder what those initials
D  |||  stand for ... (starts counting them
D  |||  off on his fingers) ...probably Program
D  |||  Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like
D  |||  a lovely place.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  It grows on you.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He notices that Tron is not listening to them any longer, but is
N  |||  gazing upwards.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (murmuring)
D  |||  I can feel it ...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn and Ram turn.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Feel what? You okay?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  Alan-One...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Yes... he's got something to tell me...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram and Tron look out at the distant tall tower.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  You think we can make it there?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  We have to.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (pointing to a corner
D  |||  of the cave)
D  |||  Hey, what's that?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They all look back, into the darkness behind them. A glowing stream
N  |||  can just be seen. Ram gets up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  it's just what we need.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram and Tron are drinking, kneeling at the stream of flowing,
N  |||  brilliant LIGHT.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Oh, that's nice. You always forget how
D  |||  good fresh energy feels, till you get
D  |||  to a pure source...
D  |||  (to Flynn)
D  |||  Have some...you'll need it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn goes to the stream, dips his hands in, takes a drink.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (wiping his mouth)
D  |||  well... when do we pay a call on the ol'
D  |||  Master Control?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Ram are taken aback.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  What, just the three of us?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  You know anybody that's got an army for
D  |||  rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said
D  |||  to go take that sucker out. An' let's
D  |||  face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any
D  |||  weaker. I feel like hittin' him now,
D  |||  while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve...
D  |||  what does he care whether you guys get
D  |||  killed, long as he keeps rakin' in
D  |||  quarters?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  (to Tron)
D  |||  Do you know what he's talking about?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (to Flynn)
D  |||  I have to find out what Alan wants...
D  |||  that comes first.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Okay, that's first. Maybe he knows
D  |||  what to -
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND. Flynn looks up sharply.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (CONT.)
D  |||  What's that?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the
N  |||  men holds up his cycle handlebars, and the three cycles SIZZLE back
N  |||  into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
N  |||  avenues of escape in the terrain below.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (points)
D  |||  How about over there...that empty
D  |||  memory?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (shakes head)
D  |||  No good...they might block off the
D  |||  old chip.
D  |||  (points)
D  |||  This way.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
N  |||  the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
N  |||  EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
N  |||  arroyo.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
N  |||  entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
N  |||  narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
N  |||  to the edge of a gaping ravine.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
N  |||  ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
N  |||  to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  TRON'S VOICE
M  |||  The bridge! Come on!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
N  |||  lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
N  |||  three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
N  |||  turning the corner.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the turret swings around and focuses on the bridge.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
N  |||  the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
N  |||  tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
N  |||  him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
N  |||  and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
N  |||  SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
N  |||  below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
N  |||  speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram is badly injured, unconscious. Flynn struggles to his feet,
N  |||  sees the tank turret swiveling towards him, grabs Ram and picks him
N  |||  up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  struggling with Ram's limp body, wedging himself into a narrow crack.

E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
N  |||  behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
N  |||  the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
N  |||  blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
N  |||  lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  (to lieutenant)
D  |||  Make contact with master Control...
D  |||  (smiles)
D  |||  he'll be pleased to hear we're all
D  |||  finished with that User he sent us.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
N  |||  the cityscape tower in the distance.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
N  |||  moving in his direction.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
N  |||  getting darker.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  You gonna make it?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
N  |||  lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
N  |||  leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
N  |||  out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  arriving in front of a block-like shape, with a narrow opening.
N  |||  Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
N  |||  and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  sitting down inside the hiding place, collapsing. Ram is unconscious
N  |||  anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  FADE TO BLACK:
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
N  |||  platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
N  |||  Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
N  |||  then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
N  |||  looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
N  |||  the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
N  |||  glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
N  |||  it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
C  |||  RUMBLE.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (holding onto
D  |||  the wall)
D  |||  What's goin' on?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  (looking around, weak)
D  |||  We're inside a Recognizer...
D  |||  (to Flynn)
D  |||  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (stumbling, trying to
D  |||  keep his balance)
D  |||  Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
N  |||  instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
N  |||  shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
N  |||  Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
N  |||  position.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as it stands up, covered with a static overlay, partially de-rezzed.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
N  |||  going fast.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  You okay? You don't look so good.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram nods weakly.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (CONT.)
D  |||  Hang on. We'll get you outta here.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
N  |||  no result.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (CONT.)
D  |||  Damn! Never fails... minute the
D  |||  warranty runs out...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  Come here.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
N  |||  Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
N  |||  Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hey... !
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  RAM
D  |||  Little more juice's all it needs...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
N  |||  Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
N  |||  but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
N  |||  gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  DISSOLVE TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
N  |||  landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
N  |||  rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
N  |||  NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
N  |||  figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
N  |||  it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
N  |||  figure, dissolving it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
N  |||  figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
N  |||  Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
N  |||  at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
N  |||  head sadly, but walks on.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  This is what he was looking for. He looks from side to side,
N  |||  figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
N  |||  building stand a small group of the memory guards.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of the city, and the tower and beam rising high into the air, with
N  |||  Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  over the complex landscape, of the distant city and tower, with
N  |||  Sark's carrier far away, nearing the city.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
N  |||  sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
N  |||  then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
N  |||  One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
N  |||  gives a violent shake, then stops.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Never gonna figure out how to work
D  |||  this thing...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  There's a NOISE from above. He looks up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see a bright glow behind one of the pieces of equipment.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
N  |||  to be still examining things.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Appearing again, peeking around the corner. It comes forward, trying
N  |||  to get a look at Flynn. The BIT.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
N  |||  a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
N  |||  comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Okay -- hold it right there!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
N  |||  recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
N  |||  sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  Yes!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The Bit subsides into energy form again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (still suspicious)
D  |||  What do you mean, "'yes"?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  From now on, whenever the Bit speaks, it is a ball-shaped character,
N  |||  red or green, with a hint of a face, but as soon as it stops
N  |||  speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  That all you can say?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  (of course not,
D  |||  you know better)
D  |||  No, nyet, negatory, not on your
D  |||  tintype, no way.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Oh. Anything else?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  only yes and no...
D  |||  (it dawns)
D  |||  You're a bit.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  (hippie)
D  |||  For sure...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  where's your program? Won't it miss you?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  No...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn eyes the bit cautiously.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  I'm your program?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  (emphatic)
D  |||  Right on the money!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (sighs)
D  |||  Another mouth to feed... you don't by any
D  |||  chance know how to drive this crate?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
N  |||  platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
N  |||  stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
N  |||  grabs the cross-bar.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (CONT.)
D  |||  Like so?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Before the Bit can answer, Flynn's power flows into the Recognizer,
N  |||  and it takes off like a bat out of hell
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  heading for the city. It lurches forward unevenly, crashing drunkenly
N  |||  into a wall and bouncing off another one.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Way to go! We're haulin'!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  Yes, okay, exactement!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
N  |||  inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
N  |||  of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
N  |||  elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
N  |||  partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
N  |||  We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
N  |||  only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
N  |||  interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
N  |||  Tron looks farther down the corridor.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see a file of the female workers coming down the corridor towards
N  |||  Tron.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as he moves back against the wall, into a niche.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
N  |||  grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
N  |||  The line of workers mechanically files on past.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
N  |||  his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
N  |||  half-heartedly.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  I'm not gonna hurt you.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She stops struggling.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON (CONT.)
D  |||  I'm going to let you go now... don't
D  |||  scream, or I'll be very sorry.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His hands loosen, and he releases her.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see the faint pale image of the girl from full face for the first
N  |||  time. She looks tired and uninterested. Her face...is Lora's face,
N  |||  still beautiful in its pallor.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Put your hand behind your back.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Slowly she obeys.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A slow smile appears on his face.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He extends his own hand to touch hers, palm to palm. As contact is
N  |||  made, a rich glow appears between the two hands, strengthening as we
N  |||  watch. A look of wonder crosses her face as the energy flows into
N  |||  her. She turns, entwining her fingers in Tron's.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  GIRL
C  |||  TRON!!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She throws her arms around him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (smiling, hugging
D  |||  her tightly)
D  |||  Yori... hey...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape...
D  |||  they've never built circuit that could
D  |||  hold you...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She-looks around nervously.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (pulling him by
D  |||  his hand)
D  |||  This way. Come on.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They walk quickly toward a flight of stairs.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori are cautiously passing along the sidewalk. We can see
N  |||  the glowing beam of the 1/0 Tower over the tops of all the buildings,
N  |||  and several half-gone programs standing around. As they pass, they
N  |||  hear snatches of conversation.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  PROGRAM
D  |||  ...artillery for Video Game Sector...
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  PROGRAM 2
M  |||  ...all mathematical functions
M  |||  transferred to...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  I can't believe how bad it's gotten
D  |||  around here since the MCP started
D  |||  taking over... all the good functions
D  |||  have shut down... everybody looks so dead...
D  |||  I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  That's all going to change, Yori...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  How?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Don't know yet... I have to get
D  |||  in touch with Alan. He was going
D  |||  to tell me how to
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly Yori looks up, sees something, grabs Tron's hand and pulls
N  |||  him back into a nearby alley. She points up in the air.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as she looks up. Recognizer.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She shivers, and holds Tron's hand tighter.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori arrive at the ground level entrance.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
N  |||  She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
N  |||  window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
N  |||  looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
N  |||  walls and floors.
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  My quarters.
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Why is everything...like this?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  It's a flat. But wait a micro...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
N  |||  a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
N  |||  the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
N  |||  three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
N  |||  charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
N  |||  the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
N  |||  aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
N  |||  extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
N  |||  shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
N  |||  diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
N  |||  her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
N  |||  by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
N  |||  Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Come here.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
N  |||  being fully rewarded for his efforts.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  You're beautiful, Yori.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
N  |||  flattened palms.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
N  |||  glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  You've grown, big program.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  I had to...in the games...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All

N  |||  what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
N  |||  room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
N  |||  other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
N  |||  moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
N  |||  trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
N  |||  are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

M  |||  SLOW, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
E  |||

N  |||  A slightly out-of-control Recognizer arrives in the city, wobbling,

E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn is having trouble controlling the Reco.

D  |||  (agreeing)
D  |||  No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
N  |||  light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
N  |||  only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
N  |||  shouting:
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  Ix-nay! Noper! Under no conditions -
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn looks frantically around, spies a large panel to one side that
N  |||  he hasn't tried yet, and slaps his palm down on it.

E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||

N  |||  with Flynn and the Bit, breaks loose, and flies through the air,
N  |||  landing in what looks like a garbage dump.

E  |||

N  |||  hovering over him.

D  |||  Catch me listening to you again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
N  |||  from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
N  |||  his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
N  |||  they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
N  |||  him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
D  |||  Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
D  |||  for your concern. So long.

E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
N  |||  the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
N  |||  bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  PROGRAMS
D  |||  I have to re-route the insurance
D  |||  information bits... Next cycle we
D  |||  start the war game simulation for

D  |||  receivable adjustment for Sark...
D  |||  Certainly... the MCP wants only
D  |||  minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  It looms high overhead.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
N  |||  approaching a wide door in the wall.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
N  |||  rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
N  |||  and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  looking upwards as they move.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
N  |||  sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
N  |||  dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
N  |||  preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
N  |||  the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
N  |||  sharp, angular surfaces. On this second story there is floor and
N  |||  ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
N  |||  and beyond.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
N  |||  a door into the inner parts of the Tower.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one
N  |||  wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
N  |||  supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
N  |||  steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
N  |||  suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
N  |||  priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
N  |||  still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
N  |||  from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
N  |||  opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
N  |||  each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
N  |||  upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
N  |||  only blackness beyond.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  asleep.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide
N  |||  room, their footsteps ECHOING.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (quietly)
D  |||  Dumont... ?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
N  |||  recognize either one.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  Yes?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (nervous)
D  |||  I... have come to communicate with
D  |||  my User.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  Hmm. A difficult proposition...
D  |||  difficult proposition at best.
D  |||  (indicates empty chamber)
D  |||  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
D  |||  exactly packing them in these days ...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Yes...what--?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  You know, not so long ago, you
D  |||  could've come in here and seen
D  |||  programs lined up all the way back
D  |||  to those doors, waiting for communion
D  |||  with their Users. The building fund
D  |||  was doing well too...but now...
D  |||  (sighs)
D  |||  ...this so-called Master Control
D  |||  Program is going around cutting
D  |||  programs off from their natural
D  |||  creators, grabbing all our believers
D  |||  and making them ride around on little
D  |||  motor scooters and shoot things at
D  |||  each other and Weiner knows what all--
D  |||  oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
D  |||  of faith...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Well I want to communicate --
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
D  |||  get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
D  |||  you in here. They hate this tower.
D  |||  They'd close it down if they dared
D  |||  to but they keep me around, in case
D  |||  one of them wants to deal with the
D  |||  other world once in a while. And
D  |||  you should hear the way they commune!
D  |||  Sounds like they were routing a
D  |||  payroll, for all the heart they put
D  |||  in it. No, I don't think you
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Dumont... my User has information
D  |||  that could -- could make this a
D  |||  free system again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  Hah.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Really. You'd have programs lined
D  |||  up around the block to use this
D  |||  place -- and no MCP looking over your
D  |||  shoulder.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  (sighs)
D  |||  When you've been in the system as long
D  |||  as I have, you hear many promises...
D  |||  many reassurances...many brave plans...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT (CONT.)
D  |||  (falling into ritual)
D  |||  Who is your User, program?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  All that is visible must grow beyond
D  |||  itself and extend into the realm of
D  |||  the invisible.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  You may pass, my friend.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness
N  |||  beyond.

E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
N  |||  the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
N  |||  down the hall, Bit following.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (CONT.)
D  |||  Looks like his kind of place, too...
D  |||  real serious.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
N  |||  the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
N  |||  corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
N  |||  golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
N  |||  surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
N  |||  Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
N  |||  which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
N  |||  sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
N  |||  surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
N  |||  this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
N  |||  within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
N  |||  down, and then up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The curving inner surfaces of the bell culminate in a round opening.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
N  |||  into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
N  |||  inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
N  |||  above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
N  |||  his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
N  |||  knowledge of the experience to come.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
N  |||  high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
N  |||  happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
N  |||  light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
N  |||  illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
N  |||  force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
N  |||  from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
N  |||  of the light.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||

N  |||  at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
N  |||  bright light at the center.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the

E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Almost gone. We can hear the voices of Sark's men outside.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  YORI (V.0.)
M  |||  Dumont! The door...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  turning back to Dumont. Behind Dumont stands Tron, framed in the
N  |||  entry to the Communication chamber.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the
N  |||  neon steps, until he is standing in front of Tron. We see that he
N  |||  has on a floor-length robe with huge shoulder pads forming
N  |||  winglike supports for the fabric.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  I have waited for this moment many
D  |||  thousands of cycles. It is time for the
D  |||  new order to begin... The Users are
D  |||  waiting.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As we watch, Tron comes forward, and grips Dumont's shoulder briefly.
N  |||  Then he holds out his hand to Yori.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see it is almost transparent, and as we watch, there is a burst
N  |||  of energy and the door disappears into thousands of sparkling dots
N  |||  of light.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  It dissolves completely. Framed in the center of the opening, stands
N  |||  Sark.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  (pointing)
D  |||  Dumont!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The blue warriors race by him, pouring into the chamber.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Dumont standing on the top of the steps, no sign of Tron and
N  |||  Yori. The guards spread out through the room, Sark strides towards
N  |||  Dumont.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Where's the program?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  (dotty-old-man act)
D  |||  Program? I'm sure you're mistaken.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  furious.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Take him!!!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As we see Tron and Yori racing through the streets, headed for it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori enter. Solar Sailer simulation hovers.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As Tron and Yori race across the floor.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  YORI (V.0.)
M  |||  This way...there's a simulation
M  |||  we can use...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  And we see them race towards it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  ABOVE, LOOKING DOWN AT THEM.
E  |||  
M  |||  AND YORI
E  |||  
N  |||  We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
N  |||  designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
N  |||  enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
N  |||  move with the speed of light. The sail is at the bow of the craft,
N  |||  and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
N  |||  made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
N  |||  look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
N  |||  transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
N  |||  information paths to the Central Processing Unit.
E  |||  
M  |||  TRON V.O.
M  |||  Can it carry us?
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  YORI V.0.
M  |||  The design is good... We don't know
M  |||  why the User abandoned the project...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
N  |||  forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
N  |||  into place.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Yori bending over a console of touch panels.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Yes...it can take us across the
D  |||  Sea of Simulation... all the way
D  |||  out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (looking out
D  |||  of hangar)
D  |||  As long as it gets us out of here
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The crowd of Sark's men are racing towards it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Bending over the console, from the POV of the sail. As we watch, a
N  |||  head leans into the frame from the right. A memory guard. Then we
N  |||  see a hand gripping a staff, and the legs of another guard on the
N  |||  left.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  On the console, as Yori leans over it. We see that she is looking at
N  |||  a map of the system, a flat grid, and on it, in miniature, are the
N  |||  beam transfer points and transmission location.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  silently. We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise. His head snaps
N  |||  up; he sees the guards.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Yori! Get down!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Abandoning any attempt at silence, leap forward, shouting, thrusting
N  |||  their staffs at Tron.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  and slashes the second across the face, knocking him out.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As Sark's men rush in and head for the stairs to the catwalks that
N  |||  ring the hangar walls. They start swarming up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:

E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as guards start swarming on board. We see Tron move forward and then
N  |||  stop, letting them come.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  looking down at the walkway. Beyond it we can see the great door
N  |||  starting to rise.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  throwing his disk. It smashes into the guards in front, tossing them
N  |||  backwards.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The great door is almost all the way up. We can see the Sail with
N  |||  its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
N  |||  racing towards the hangar.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
N  |||  We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
N  |||  connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
N  |||  guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
N  |||  There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
N  |||  his balance.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  smiling.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  We're off!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
N  |||  from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
N  |||  it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
N  |||  accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
N  |||  seconds.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
N  |||  front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
N  |||  the Solar Sailer -- racing away.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  I hope you've enjoyed being a command
D  |||  program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
D  |||  working in a pocket calculator... maybe
D  |||  one of those watches that plays "Happy
D  |||  Birthday" to its User once a year.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Now, sir... We did take care of that
D  |||  User you sent us --
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Yes, and now you've got two renegade
D  |||  programs running all the hell over the
D  |||  system in a stolen simulation.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  We'll get them, sir... These things
D  |||  take time.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  I don't have time, Sark. And neither
D  |||  do you. End of line.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  from the stern. Tron picks himself up from the floor where he was
N  |||  thrown when the Sailer took off, and heads for Yori (at the camera).
N  |||  He stops, seeing something.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  YORI V.O.
M  |||  Tron, are you all right?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron waves at her... then...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks over at the guard rail.

E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:

M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Several yards away from it. We see one of the blue warriors hanging
N  |||  on, trying to get a leg up on the rail, and we see Tron race to the
N  |||  edge, look over and see this guard.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  By the rail with the blue arms and head in the shot. Tron raises his
N  |||  disk to slam into the intruder, when suddenly a spherical glowing
N  |||  shape comes into the frame from bottom right.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  (buzzing around Tron's
D  |||  head like a fly)
D  |||  No way, not on your life, no siree!!

D  |||  You're alive!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Yeah, I... oops!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He loses his grip, and starts to fall. But Tron, just in time, grabs
N  |||  Flynn's wrist and starts to pull him up. We see the blue static guard
N  |||  disguise fade off Flynn.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  leaning over the control console anxiously, watching Tron come up
N  |||  the steps towards her with Flynn and the Bit.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As they reach her.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (nervously)
D  |||  Who is this?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Flynn look at Yori and silently mouth "Lora" in surprise...
N  |||  but then realize his mistake.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (smiling)
D  |||  Flynn...
D  |||  (he turns to
D  |||  Flynn eagerly)
D  |||  Where's Ram?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  I'm sorry, Tron... he's...
D  |||  he didn't make it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron shakes his head, sadly.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (to Yori)
D  |||  This is Flynn... the one who
D  |||  busted me out.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (to Flynn)
D  |||  Then I owe you some thanks...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  No big deal. I ought to know my way
D  |||  around that Light Cycles routine...
D  |||  I mean, I did write the program for it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (mystified)
D  |||  Wrote the...?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  It's time I levelled with you, Tron.
D  |||  I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a
D  |||  User.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  A User -- in our world?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (nods)
D  |||  Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  But -- if you're a User -- then
D  |||  everything you've done has been
D  |||  part of a plan ...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (laughs)
D  |||  You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
D  |||  to think since I got down here. I mean
D  |||  in here. Out here. Whatever.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Then...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Look, you guys know how it is. You just
D  |||  keep doin' what it looks like you're
D  |||  supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
D  |||  you hope to hell your User knows what's
D  |||  goin' on.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Well -- that's how it is for programs,
D  |||  yes, but --
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the
D  |||  time, that's how it is for Users, too.

D  |||  next move?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (smiles)
D  |||  Remember you wanted to pay a call on

C  |||  TRON (CONT.)
D  |||  We're on our way.

D  |||  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go
D  |||  up against Master

D  |||  Put him with the others?

N  |||  We see Flynn looking back the way they came. Yori is at the controls,
N  |||  with Tron beside her, his arm around her shoulders, looking at Flynn.
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  What about our friend - Sark?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Probably decided not to pursue us,
D  |||  The Sea of Simulation is tricky..
D  |||  lot of illusions...rough navigating.
D  |||  Programs have a way of just...
D  |||  disappearing here.
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Not us, I hope.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (shakes his head,

D  |||  Not with this disk. I'm going to
D  |||  check on the beam connection, Yori.
D  |||  You two can keep a watch out for
D  |||  grid bugs.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He moves off down the walkway, the Bit following. Flynn turns and
N  |||  leans out over the side.

D  |||  Boy the view from up here... you
D  |||  know the territory?

D  |||  What's wrong with that area?
E  |||  
E  |||

E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (sadly)
D  |||  The MCP blasted it... There are very
D  |||  few domains left with any power at all.
E  |||

N  |||  guards stand by his side holding their staffs against his chest.
N  |||  Dumont's face is wracked with pain, his robe torn, but his
N  |||  expression is full of determination. As we watch, another blast of
N  |||  torturous energy comes from the boots, and his face contorts. CAMERA
N  |||  PULLS BACK AND ANGLES UP to the second level where we see Sark
N  |||  looking down into the pit that is Dumont's cell.

E  |||  
N  |||  We see Tron at the bow. Flynn and Yori are up on the deck near the
N  |||  controls, with the Bit hovering over them. Yori is, pointing
N  |||  something out to Flynn.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  reacting to the sight of something ahead of the Solar Sailer.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see the transmission beam which carries the Solar Sailer
N  |||  increasing in brightness, throbbing with a pulse of mad glowing
N  |||  energy, coming towards the ship. It hits the sail, and the ship
N  |||  shivers. The whole beam is now tripled in brightness.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As Tron runs up to Yori's side. He grabs her shoulder, pulling her
N  |||  against him... they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the
N  |||  increasing beam.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (shouting)
D  |||  What is it?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Power surge... the transmission beam's
D  |||  too strong!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  We have to get off this beam!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (frantic)
D  |||  I can't. There's no junction due for at
D  |||  least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The ship is throbbing and jerking, bits of it de-rezzing.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn looks around, points to one side.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  There's another beam!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  It's too far!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn suddenly looks to the bow of the ship, makes a decision, and
N  |||  races forward.

E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Flynn race to the bow, where the horrendous power of the beam
N  |||  is blasting away at the sails. He slows down, but keeps going.

M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see Flynn emerge, leaning out into the beam, his face brilliantly
N  |||  illuminated by the beam. He reaches forward with one arm.

N  |||  He is lying spread eagled at the bow, with one arm in the light. He
N  |||  raises his other arm and points at the beam which was so close, but
N  |||  too far to reach. Suddenly his whole body glows with the same
N  |||  intensity as the beam.

E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see the new beam from Flynn's arm flash over to the neighboring
N  |||  transmission beam and connect. We see the ship pulsing, and then
N  |||  breaking free of the old beam, following the new path, and connecting
N  |||  to the safe beam.
E  |||  
N  |||  The craft starts to travel safely on its way.

M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as they reach the deck in front of Tron, as he holds Flynn. We can
N  |||  see Yori's anxious face to one side. Flynn's head comes up for a
N  |||  moment, dazed.
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (weakly)
D  |||  Did we make it?
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Yes.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn smiles weakly.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hooray for our side...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He faints.

N  |||  Her face, upside-down, peering downward.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Yori is sitting on the floor beside the control console with Flynn
N  |||  stretched out beside her, his head in her lap. Her hands are on
N  |||  either side of his face. Tron is seated across from them and the Bit
N  |||  is quietly floating beside him. In b.g. we SEE that the Solar Sailer
N  |||  is passing through a series of narrow canyons.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hey... you guys OK?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON

D  |||  How about you?
E  |||  
E  |||

D  |||  Aah, I'm fine... little hung over
D  |||  is all...
E  |||

C  |||  YORI
D  |||  How did you do that, Flynn?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (sitting up)
D  |||  Elementary physics... a beam of
D  |||  energy can always be diverted...
D  |||  ooh, my head
D  |||  (looks around --
D  |||  to Yori)
D  |||  Are we there yet, Mommy?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Almost... I just have to adjust our
D  |||  course at the next junction. I'd better
D  |||  go check the instruments ...

N  |||  She heads O.S., toward the bow.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The Sailer is about to pass the mouth of another canyon.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron looks away from Flynn for a moment to check the Sailer's
N  |||  progress.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the new canyon comes into sight. CAMERA LOOKS UP AND UP... to the
N  |||  immense bulk of the aircraft carrier, moving fast toward the Sailer.
E  |||

E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||

N  |||  The carrier lurches forward and rams the Sailer, splitting it in
N  |||  half.

E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Falling on top of one another, Flynn trying to pull Yori out of the

N  |||  hovers beside them. A second level of the carrier, with an open hold,
N  |||  comes rushing at them.
E  |||

C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  Tron... ?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn looks down at his hands and turns away, leaning against the
N  |||  wall.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  He's dead.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  (sighs, looks
D  |||  at Flynn)
D  |||  And who is this?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  He's a User, Dumont. He came to
D  |||  our world... trying to help us...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Her voice breaks, she turns away.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  (despairing)
D  |||  If the Users can no longer help us...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His voice trails off. Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the
N  |||  cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the
N  |||  cell door.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  So... we have erased the program that -
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As he catches sight of Flynn, his voice falters.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK (CONT.)
D  |||  You! No!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn looks up curiously.
E  |||

C  |||  SARK (CONT.)
D  |||  You died! I saw you!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Not me, boss.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Well... we can take care of that
D  |||  soon enough.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He points to Dumont. The guards grab him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK (CONT.)
D  |||  Take this program to the holding pit.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The guards start to drag Dumont out.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (rushing after him)
D  |||  Dumont...!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A guard pushes her roughly to the end of the cell.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  (indicates Dumont)
D  |||  I'm taking our friend here, and
D  |||  some other religious fanatics, to
D  |||  Master Control... the MCP has expressed
D  |||  an interest in assimilating them --
D  |||  probably for archival purposes.
D  |||  I'm not going back to the Game Grid
D  |||  on this ship, though -- I'll take
D  |||  the Transport Beam.
D  |||  (smiles)
D  |||  Less traffic. But when I disembark,
D  |||  this ship...and everything that remains
D  |||  on board...will automatically de-rez.
D  |||  This means you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Enjoy your trip...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  LAUGHING, Sark leaves. The guards, with Dumont in custody, follow.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  into the cell that holds a dozen dejected, defeated, aging programs,
N  |||  the I/0 Tower guardians. We see the door to the cell open and guards
N  |||  beginning to herd them out.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  where we can see Sark walking towards an open portal. He looks down
N  |||  into the cells at his feet and laughs again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  staring up as Sark moves past their cell and out of view.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of the carrier approaching a flat-topped mountain, with the
N  |||  communication beam of the MCP visible at the very center.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of the MCP's mesa moving closer, the only structure visible in a
N  |||  vast plain covered with a glowing grid.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We can see the observation port and below that a section of the
N  |||  ship's structure is moving forward.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LIEUTENANT (V.O.)
D  |||  Docking module prepared to disengage, sir.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark's hand touching a control panel.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As the landing pod disengages completely, floating away from the
N  |||  carrier and then starting its final journey to the MCP, picking up
N  |||  speed on a straight and even course. We can see a small speck
N  |||  clinging to one side of the pod...
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  543A CLOSE UP - SPECK 543A
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  TRON, holding himself braced into a narrow crack.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Yori is sitting with her head in her hands. Flynn is at the door
N  |||  testing it, running his finger along the edges.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Of landing pod flying over the glowing grid that surrounds the MCP's
N  |||  mesa.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  from behind the carrier of the pod getting smaller with distance.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Steep cliff face of the MCP's mesa is coming closer and closer, more
N  |||  and more detail visible.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  tiny against the massive bulk of the MCP's mesa, descending for
N  |||  landing. The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
N  |||  shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes,
N  |||  fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
N  |||  structure.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel. From
N  |||  the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly.
N  |||  Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door, and we
N  |||  gradually are given a view of the MCP, two or three miles away at
N  |||  the center of the plain ahead. The structure is a series of gleaming
N  |||  black blades, forming a great cylinder, and the communication beam
N  |||  rises out of the center of this cylinder.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  floating upwards and forward.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn still at the door. Suddenly his hand goes right through the
N  |||  door.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hey!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The door is disappearing, dissolving.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (continuing; turning)
D  |||  Look, the door's almost...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He stops in horror.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Yori is standing lethargically staring at her hands... through them.
N  |||  She is de-rezzing too. Her whole body becoming transparent. She looks
N  |||  up dimly at Flynn, with no expression.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn races back to her and takes her in his arms roughly, hugging
N  |||  her close, his energy flowing into her.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is
N  |||  too late to save her. Her eyes are half-closed.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Yori!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
N  |||  Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
N  |||  floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
N  |||  Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (in awe)
D  |||  You... you brought me back...?
D  |||  Why...? How ... ?
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn lets go of her.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  I'm gonna need your help. Hey, Bit!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
N  |||  to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
N  |||  Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
N  |||  Suddenly the Bit pops into life.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  Yes!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Let's get outta here.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  They head for the door.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
N  |||  them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
N  |||  The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
N  |||  path.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  on duty. He hears a NOISE and turns... and in a flash of light a
N  |||  speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
N  |||  over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
N  |||  arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  It is Tron. He steps over the body of the Lieutenant.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  from right outside. We see the prisoners beginning to file inside,
N  |||  up the final slope leading to the base of the MCP.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  to the MCP. As the guardian programs enter. Sark stands waiting,
N  |||  watching them, his back to the camera.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
N  |||  beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
N  |||  finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
N  |||  network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
N  |||  surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
N  |||  the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
N  |||  impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
N  |||  but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
N  |||  inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
N  |||  continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
N  |||  STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
N  |||  the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  (echoing, booming)
D  |||  I am delighted that so many of you
D  |||  could turn out to give your
D  |||  power over to me...
E  |||

N  |||  them starting to de-rez.

C  |||  MCP
D  |||  You're very lucky, all of you. You
D  |||  are participating in the creation of
D  |||  the single most powerful program in
D  |||  the history of the system... of all
D  |||  systems...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The programs begin to disappear, one by one.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  A program with a will... with
D  |||  ambition... a superior form of
D  |||  life...

E  |||  
N  |||  Sark stands in front of Dumont.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Go!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Dumont's face is devoid of hope. He starts into the MCP's inner
N  |||  chamber.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  seeing the MCP, reacting.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Over Dumont's shoulder, with a view of the MCP. Zoom IN on MCP's
N  |||  face.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Welcome!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn and Yori race into view. We can see two of the memory guards
N  |||  in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
N  |||  the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
N  |||  the window.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Check out the controls.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As Yori looks over the control conso1e.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  We're getting closer.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Down the length of the carrier. It is de-rezzing, parts of it gone
N  |||  already. We see the CPU approaching, as the carrier rises.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The carrier drifts over the edge of the mesa, high above it, whole
N  |||  sections only visible as outlines.
E  |||  
E  |||

E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  CAMERA MOVING FORWARD towards the MCP's beam.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He is slowly disappearing.
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Dumont, I'm so pleased that we've
D  |||  finally come to terms with one
D  |||  another...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark is standing, looking in the opening, waiting for the signal to
N  |||  depart. His back is to the camera.
E  |||  
C  |||  VOICE
C  |||  SARK!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark turns, curious, eyes widen incredulously..
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We SEE Tron standing, legs spread, arms poised by his sides, disk in
N  |||  one hand. It gives off a pure white light.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  I don't know how you survived,
D  |||  slave.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  It doesn't matter. Prepare to
D  |||  terminate.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark flings his disk with a violent jerk of his wrist.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
N  |||  under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
N  |||  again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
N  |||  two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
N  |||  races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  I can rev this baby up a little
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks out sees something, does a double-take, looks again
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  Wait a minute Yori! YORI!! LOOK!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as Yori runs to Flynn's side and-peers down.
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
C  |||  TRON!!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  tears of joy streaming down her face.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  the fight continuing.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Flynn, we've got to help him!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Let's get some power here.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His hands, laying on the control console, begin to send forth great
N  |||  pulses of glowing energy into the carrier.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark's face.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  You are very persistent, Tron.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron's disk circles Sark, attacking twice. Sark deflects it and
N  |||  immediately throws his own disk.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  racing almost side by side through the air.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as the two disks come at him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  I'm also better than you....
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He leaps into the air, grabs his own disk, pulling his legs up as
N  |||  Sark's disk passes under him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Making a sharp turn in the air.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks over his shoulder, sees the disk coming at him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As he slams his own disk into Sark's, using his as a shield.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  584A MED. SHOT SARK 584A
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  Very clever, Tron. You know you
D  |||  should have joined me.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron hurls again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn is at the controls, transferring power.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Any response?
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  It's starting
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  She looks down at the battle. Her hand reaches over and grips
N  |||  Flynn's tightly.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He catches his own disk, spots Tron's coming at him right behind,
N  |||  and holds up his own disk as a shield.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK
D  |||  We would have made a great team.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  turning sideways in its flight, edge on.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  With a CRASH and explosion of light, Tron's disk cuts right through
N  |||  Sark's disk, and on through Sark's head. The disk shatters, and we
N  |||  see Sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the
N  |||  disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. We can see
N  |||  energy pouring out of this wound like blood.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark falls, dead, face first.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  wailing past Sark's body.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  as he goes in the MCP's inner chamber.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  (before he sees Tron)
D  |||  It is very good that you...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  framed in the doorway.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  I don't think it is good for you, MCP.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Sark! How have you allowed this
D  |||  program to
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Sark's out. Would you like to
D  |||  leave a message?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  I am the message. The only message.
D  |||  Sark!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
N  |||  returns to him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  (continuing)
C  |||  SARK!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over
N  |||  to him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Dumont is transparent. Tron runs up to him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (trying to pull
D  |||  Dumont away from wall)
D  |||  Dumont!
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  No... Tron ... must... destroy
D  |||  MCP... first...
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's
D  |||  Flynn?
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  (very weak)
D  |||  They may be... de-rezzed... on
D  |||  the carrier ... hurry...
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He turns, murder in his eyes, draws back his arm for the throw.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  Program... stop. This is not allowed!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron throws.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The disk smashes into him. Once, twice...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  I will not allow this Sark!
D  |||  (thundering)
C  |||  SARK!!!
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The voice reverberates, shaking the chamber. Tron continues to throw.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark's dead hand. We see the circuit pattern of the mesa top begin
N  |||  to glow around the hand, throbbing with energy. The hand moves.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  MCP
D  |||  (thundering)
C  |||  SARK!!!
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His body is glowing, expanding. He starts to rise, his face looks up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping
N  |||  hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out,
N  |||  from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the
N  |||  beam.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  very close.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Yori, steer us over the beam,
D  |||  right next to it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  (going to controls)
D  |||  Why? What are you going to do?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (staring down)
D  |||  Jump.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Yori looks up.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  But... won't you be de-rezzed?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (turns to her)
D  |||  Probably.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  about to fire again. There's a sudden roar and Tron turns.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Who rips open the doorway into the MCP and advances.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
N  |||  goes up to him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  Flynn... you can't... I
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  (lays finger on
D  |||  her lips)
D  |||  Shhhhh.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He takes her in his arms.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (CONT.)
D  |||  (whispering)
D  |||  I'm sure Tron wouldn't mind if...
D  |||  just once...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
N  |||  change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
N  |||  love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Finally Flynn pulls away from her. Her eyes stay shut for a second,
N  |||  then open.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Don't worry.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
N  |||  on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
N  |||  shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
N  |||  directly into the center of MCP itself.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
N  |||  his voice is that of the MCP.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  SARK/MCP
D  |||  End of line, program...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
N  |||  static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
N  |||  Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
N  |||  Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
N  |||  and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
N  |||  and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
N  |||  cones. And connects.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A brilliant explosion of lights bursts out.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
N  |||  into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
N  |||  is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
N  |||  padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
N  |||  wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
N  |||  see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
N  |||  too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
N  |||  the MCP glows brighter and brighter.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  on the bridge of the carrier looking down at this.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A fountain of energy explodes upwards like a Supernova, right at the
N  |||  camera.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  shielding her face from the power of the blast.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The nova of energy bursting upwards. We start to see the glow
N  |||  returning to the surrounding domains, as the nova dissipates,
N  |||  leaving the sky full of sparkling stars.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  still shielding her eyes, but looking out in wonder at the domains
N  |||  regaining their life.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  one domain after another, scattered around the horizon, glows
N  |||  brightly, increasing.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The carrier starts to descend.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
N  |||  programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
N  |||  faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
N  |||  her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
N  |||  in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  (laughing)
D  |||  Nice...
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  It's something Users do.
E  |||  
C  |||  TRON
D  |||  Where's Flynn?
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks up at the bridge.
E  |||  
C  |||  YORI
D  |||  He's gone. He went into the beam.
D  |||  He saved you. He saved all of us.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
N  |||  the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.
E  |||  
C  |||  DUMONT
D  |||  He really was a User...
E  |||  
C  |||  BIT
D  |||  (quietly, sadly)
D  |||  Yes...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
N  |||  shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.
E  |||  
M  |||  DISSOLVE TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  and returning to the real world.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
N  |||  blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
N  |||  chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
N  |||  shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
N  |||  back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
N  |||  himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
N  |||  flesh and blood.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
N  |||  weak sunlight coming in.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
N  |||  Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
N  |||  coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
N  |||  document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
N  |||  face.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
N  |||  tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO:
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Bleary but excited, they gaze happily at the information on Alan's
N  |||  CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room, waving his printout.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  Hey -- you guys
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Before he can say anything more, Alan turns to greet him, holding up
N  |||  a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Flynn! I made it. I worked out some
D  |||  new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk,
D  |||  and -- it's running.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  I know, I met him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
N  |||  from Tron and Yori in the other world. He checks himself.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (CONT.)
D  |||  I mean, I saw it read-up -
D  |||  hey, look at this.
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  He shows them the printout. It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
N  |||  reading it to figure out its significance.
E  |||

D  |||  Your old files -- ?

D  |||  And Dillinger's instructions to
D  |||  divert them -- it's all there -
D  |||  look, even his home phone number,
D  |||  when he logged on.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN
D  |||  Oh, that is beautiful. You've got
D  |||  the goods...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  Flynn folds up the printout, puts it in his pocket. Alan and Lora
N  |||  get up, stretch, start wandering slowly toward the door with him.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN
D  |||  You're telling me...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  As they talk, CAMERA PANS over to Alan's color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
N  |||  on it.
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off, and
N  |||  are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
N  |||  typical video game:
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
N  |||  electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
N  |||  first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
N  |||  directions.

E  |||  
M  |||  FLYNN (V.0.)
M  |||  you have any idea how much I can sue these
M  |||  jokers for?
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  LORA (V.0.)
M  |||  Well, just don't forget your old friends
M  |||  when you're rich and famous.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  FLYNN (V.0.)
M  |||  Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
M  |||  this joint by then...
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN (V.O.)
D  |||  Your friend Dillinger sure won't...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
N  |||  EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
N  |||  SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
N  |||  formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
N  |||  HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  FLYNN (V.O.)
D  |||  Hey, you know anybody who wants to
D  |||  get hold of some video games... cheap?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  LORA (V.O.)
D  |||  You're getting out of the business?
E  |||  
E  |||  
C  |||  ALAN (V.O.)
D  |||  Shouldn't you wait till your
D  |||  lawsuit's settled?
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  FLYNN (V.0.)
M  |||  Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
M  |||  video games to last me a good long
M  |||  time. I feel like gettin' into some
M  |||  real life...
E  |||  
E  |||  
N  |||  at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
N  |||  yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
N  |||  HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  BLACK OUT.
E  |||
