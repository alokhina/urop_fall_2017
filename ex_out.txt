M  |||  FADE IN:
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. HADES - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  We are MOVING TOWARD the Tyrell Corporation across a
N  |||  vast plain of industrialization, menacing shapes on the
N  |||  horizon, stacks belching flames five hundred feet into
N  |||  the sky the color of cigar ash. The CAMERA MOVES INTO
N  |||  a window in the large pyramid-shaped building. A man
N  |||  is sitting at a table. Another man enters the room and
N  |||  sits down. The following scene is reflected in the eye
N  |||  until HOLDEN is seated.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. TYRELL CORPORATION INTERROGATION ROOM - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  The eye is magnified and deeply revealed. Flecks of
N  |||  green and yellow in a field of milky blue. Icy fila-
N  |||  ments surround the undulating center.
E  |||  
N  |||  The eye is brown in a tiny screen. On the metallic
N  |||  surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
N  |||  etched. There's a touch-light panel across the top
N  |||  and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
N  |||  fluctuation of the iris.
E  |||  
N  |||  The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
N  |||  on a table between two men. The man talking is big,
N  |||  looks like an overstuffed kid. LEON it says on his
N  |||  breast pocket. He's dressed in a warehouseman's uni-
N  |||  form and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his
N  |||  lap. Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.
E  |||  
N  |||  The man facing him is lean, hollow-cheeked, and dressed
N  |||  in grey. Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
N  |||  or an accountant. His name is Holden and he's all
N  |||  business, except for the sweat on his face.
E  |||  
N  |||  The room is large and humid. Rows of salvaged junk
N  |||  are stacked neatly against the walls. Two large FANS
N  |||  WHIRR above their heads.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Okay if I talk?
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden doesn't answer. He's centering Leon's eye on
N  |||  the machine.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  I kinda get nervous when I take
D  |||  tests.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Don't move.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Sorry.
E  |||  
N  |||  He tries not to move, but finally his lips can't help
N  |||  a sheepish smile.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  I already had I.Q. test this year...
D  |||  but I don't think I never had a...
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Reaction time is a factor in this so
D  |||  please pay attention. Answer as quickly
D  |||  as you can.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Uh... sure...
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  One one eight seven at Hunterwasser...
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Oh... that's the hotel.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  What?
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Where I live.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Nice place ?
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Huh? Sure. Yeah. I guess. Is
D  |||  that.. part of the test ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden smiles a patronising smile.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Warming you up, that's all.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Oh.
D  |||  It's
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  You're in a desert, walking along
D  |||  in the sand when....
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Is this the test now ?
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Yes. You're in a desert, walking
D  |||  along in the sand when all of a sudden
D  |||  you lookdown and see a.....
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  What one ?
E  |||  
N  |||  It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  What ?
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  What desert ?
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Doesn't make any difference what
D  |||  desert.. it's completely hypothetical.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  But how come I'd be there?
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want
D  |||  to be by yourself.. who knows.
D  |||  So you look down and see a
D  |||  tortoise. It's crawling toward
D  |||  you....
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  A tortoise. What's that?
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Know what a turtle is?
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Of course.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Same thing.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  I never seen a turtle.
E  |||  
N  |||  He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  But I understand what you mean.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  You reach down and flip the
D  |||  tortoise over on its back, Leon.
E  |||  
N  |||  Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
N  |||  in the Voight-Kampff. One of the needles quivers
N  |||  slightly.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  You make these questions, Mr.
D  |||  Holden, or they write 'em down
D  |||  for you?
E  |||  
N  |||  Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
N  |||  up the pace.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  The tortoise lays on its back,
D  |||  its belly baking in the hot sun,
D  |||  beating its legs trying to turn
D  |||  itself over. But it can't. Not
D  |||  without your help. But you're not
D  |||  helping.
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon's upper lip is quivering.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Whatya mean, I'm not helping?
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  I mean you're not helping! Why is
D  |||  that, Leon?
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden looks hard at Leon, piercing look.
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon is flushed with anger, breathing hard, it's a
N  |||  bad moment, he might erupt.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly Holden grins disarmingly.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  They're just questions, Leon.
D  |||  In answer to your query, they're
D  |||  written down for me. It's a
D  |||  test, designed to provoke an
D  |||  emotional response.
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon is glaring now, the blush subsides, his anger
N  |||  slightly defused.
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden smiles cheerfully, very smooth.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Shall we continue?
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon nods, still frowning, suspiciously.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Describe in single words. Only
D  |||  the good things that come into
D  |||  your mind. About your mother.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  My...
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon looks shocked, surprised. But the needles in
N  |||  the computer barely move. Holden goes for the in-
N  |||  side of his coat. But big Leon is faster. His
N  |||  laser burns a hole the size of a nickel through
N  |||  Holden's stomach. Unlike a bullet, a laser causes
N  |||  no impact. It goes through Holden's shoulder and
N  |||  comes out his back, clean as a whistle. Like a
N  |||  rag doll he falls back into the seat. Big slow Leon
N  |||  is already walking away, but he stops, turns, and
N  |||  with a little smile of satisfaction fires through
N  |||  the back of the seat.
E  |||  
N  |||  As Leon walks out of the room the Voight-Kampff
N  |||  begins to blink, faint but steady.

M  |||  EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Lights from the blimp flash along the street and wipe
N  |||  across the crowds of pedestrians as the VOICE TRACK
N  |||  CONTINUES TO BLARE from above.
E  |||  
N  |||  A portable noodle bar is crowded with customers, sit-
N  |||  ting on stools slurping their food out of bowls.
E  |||  
N  |||  DECKARD is standing near the noodle bar waiting for a
N  |||  seat. He's in his thirties, wiry, athletic, rumpled,
N  |||  used, unshaven. He's holding a newspaper, made of
N  |||  tissue paper, open while he glances at the blimp
N  |||  passing NOISILY overhead. Then he notices the
C  |||  COUNTERMAN.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Counterman is beckoning to him to a newly vacated
N  |||  seat.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard sits down at the noodle bar and the Counterman,
N  |||  an elderly Japanese, slaps a menu in front of him.
E  |||  
N  |||  No words on the menu, just pictures of sliced fish
N  |||  parts.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard points to a particular item and holds up four
N  |||  fingers.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Counterman looks at the item on the menu, confirms
N  |||  the order by holding up two fingers.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard shakes his head "no" and repeats his four
N  |||  fingers.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Counterman nods, corrected and hurries off.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard glances overhead.
E  |||  
N  |||  The blimp drifts off among the buildings like a fish
N  |||  disappearing in seaweed, the NOISY VOICE doing a
N  |||  diminuendo.
E  |||  
N  |||  Whap. The Counterman slaps a bowl of rice and a pot
N  |||  of tea in front of Deckard. Then he puts the little
N  |||  bowl with the two slices of fish on the counter.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks at the fish. Two slices of fish.
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks at the Counterman and holds up four fingers.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Counterman looks down at the two slices of fish,
N  |||  looks like two to him. He looks at Deckard as though
N  |||  Deckard was a fool and holds up two fingers. He can
N  |||  count!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stares bleakly at the fish. Can't win.
E  |||  
N  |||  He starts to eat and that's when he feels a tap on his
N  |||  shoulder. He glances over his right shoulder.
E  |||  
N  |||  A huge cop in uniform is looming behind him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard feels funny, looks left.
E  |||  
N  |||  Another cop is looming over his left shoulder.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is tapped again from the right.
E  |||  
N  |||  Turning again he realizes that it isn't the cop tapping
N  |||  him, it's the short Japanese guy next to the cop. The
N  |||  guy's got beady eyes and lots of energy. His name is
C  |||  GAFF.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (in Japanese)
D  |||  *** You will be required to
D  |||  accompany me, sir. ***
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard doesn't understand Japanese, thinks the man
N  |||  wants a seat.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Wait your turn, pal.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard turns back to his food.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (in Japanese)
D  |||  *** If you do not comply with an
D  |||  official request, I will be
D  |||  obliged to exert my authority. ***
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is ignoring Gaff but the Counterman leans in
N  |||  Deckard's face and translates.
E  |||  
M  |||  THE COUNTERMAN
M  |||  He say, you go with him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard turns and finds Gaff waving a badge in his face.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (in Japanese)
D  |||  *** To defy duly constituted
D  |||  authority is to flaunt the public
D  |||  good. ***
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard doesn't understand a word.
E  |||  
M  |||  THE COUNTERMAN
M  |||  He say, you're under arrest, Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard turns back to his food.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Tell him he's got the wrong guy.
D  |||  (turning to Gaff
D  |||  loudly)
D  |||  You got the wrong guy, pal.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (in Japanese)
D  |||  *** Wrong guy, my ass. You're
D  |||  known as The Boogeyman in every
D  |||  mean joint in town. ***
E  |||  
M  |||  THE COUNTERMAN
M  |||  He say, Boogeyman.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard flinches at the word "Boogeyman," but goes on
N  |||  eating. But now we know, and he knows it's not a
N  |||  mistake.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (in Japanese)
D  |||  *** You are a Blade Runner in the
D  |||  Four Sector and after the slaughter
D  |||  at the steel shop they called you
D  |||  Mister Nighttime. ***
E  |||  
M  |||  THE COUNTERMAN
M  |||  He say, Brade Runner. He say,
M  |||  Mister Nightime.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Tell him I'm eating.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (to the Counterman
D  |||  in Japanese)
D  |||  *** Please tell this notorious
D  |||  gentleman that I am acting as an
D  |||  emmisary from Captain Bryant and
D  |||  Captain Bryant has ordered me to
D  |||  bring Mr. Deckard to headquarters
D  |||  even if I have to serve him like
D  |||  so much sushi. ***
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is continuing to eat but he has reacted to
N  |||  Gaff's repeated use of the word "Bryant."
E  |||  
M  |||  THE COUNTERMAN
M  |||  (to Deckard)
M  |||  He say, you be ornery, okay. He
M  |||  say big boss Bryant give him
M  |||  permission to use violence make
M  |||  arrest. He say Bryant tell him
M  |||  rearrange your brains akay. Make
M  |||  you raw fish.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks disgusted and resigned.

E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard, still holding his bowl of food, is climbing
N  |||  into a spinner behind Gaff as the two cops loom over
N  |||  him. One of the cops shuts the spinner door behind
N  |||  Deckard and the spinner lifts off in a flurry of wind.

N  |||  Deckard is sitting in the passenger seat, eating while
N  |||  he watches the maze of suspension bridges, platforms
N  |||  and catwalks swim by below. The tops of larger build-

N  |||  of neon ads.

N  |||  Deckard is sitting gloomily in the passenger seat,
N  |||  still eating from his bowl with chopsticks as Gaff
N  |||  maneuvers the spinner through the city canyons chat-
N  |||  tering in rapid Japanese.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (in Japanese)
D  |||  I told Bryant I could take care of
D  |||  this myself. Just move me up.
D  |||  I'll do the job, I told him. Five
D  |||  phonies. I just air 'em out.
D  |||  (he imitates shooting)
D  |||  Bow! Bow! Bow!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks at Gaff uncomprehendingly.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (continuing in Japanese)
D  |||  But no, he says. Bryant thinks
D  |||  you're hot shit, smartest spotter,
D  |||  baddest Blade Runner. You don't
D  |||  look so hot to me. Don't even
D  |||  shave. Bad grooming reflects on
D  |||  the whole department. You don't
D  |||  dress well, that reflects on me...
D  |||  makes the whole department look
D  |||  like shit.
D  |||  The skin jobs look better than you
D  |||  do! What's the point of wiping out
D  |||  skin jobs if they look better than
D  |||  Enforcement? pretty soon the public
D  |||  will want skin jobs for Enforcement.
D  |||  I guess you'd prefer that, hunh?
D  |||  That why you quit?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks at Gaff. He hasn't understood a word.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I don't understand a word you're
D  |||  saying.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff glares and mutters, turning his attention to navi-
N  |||  gation of the spinner.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (in Japanese)
D  |||  Exactly! Whatta jerk! If I wasn't
D  |||  up for promotion I'd put this baby
D  |||  in a hot spin and leave your dinner

N  |||  answer. Bryant dismisses Gaff with a head movement.
N  |||  Deckard glares at Gaff who glares back as he departs.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  You wouldn't have come if I'd just
D  |||  asked you to. Siddown, pal.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard glares at Bryant without moving.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Don't be an asshole, Deckard. I
D  |||  got five skin jobs walking the
D  |||  streets.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard smiles and sits down.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  They jumped a shuttle offworld.
D  |||  Killed the crew and passengers.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard reacts. This isn't usual.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  We found the shuttle floating off
D  |||  the coast two weeks ago. So we
D  |||  know they're around.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Embarrassing.
E  |||  
N  |||  Bryant is pouring bourbon into a thick shot glass. He
N  |||  passes the amber tumbler to Deckard who takes it and
N  |||  holds it to the light.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  No, sir! Not fucking embarrassing
D  |||  ... Because nobody's ever gonna
D  |||  find out they're down here because
D  |||  you're gonna spot 'em an' you're
D  |||  gonna air 'em out.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard downs his drink and slides the empty back.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Not me, Bryant. I won't work for
D  |||  you anymore. Give it to Holden,
D  |||  he's good.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard turns to go.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  I did.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard freezes and turns back.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  And?
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  He can breathe okay... as long as
D  |||  nobody unplugs him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is impressed.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Not good enough. Not as
D  |||  good as you. I need ya, Deck.
D  |||  This is a bad one, the worst yet.
D  |||  I need the old Blade Runner, I
D  |||  need your magic.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard meets Bryant's pleading eyes for a beat.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I was quit when I walked in
D  |||  here...
D  |||  (pause)
D  |||  ... I'm twice as quit now.
D  |||  See ya, Bryant.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard turns to go.
E  |||  
N  |||  Bryant's pleading look turns abruptly cold and hard.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Stop the fuck right where you are!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard freezes at the hard tone.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  You know the score, pal. When
D  |||  you're not a cop, you're little
D  |||  people.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Forgot there for a minute about
D  |||  the little people. No choices
D  |||  I guess.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  No choice, pal.
E  |||

E  |||  
M  |||  INT. WHITE TILED ROOM (DAY)
E  |||  
N  |||  We are looking at the bright image of a NAKED MAN in a
N  |||  white tiled room with a white floor... an abbatoir
N  |||  without blood. The naked man is very athletic. His
N  |||  face reveals nothing as he executes one physical demon-
N  |||  stration after another.... one handed pushups, gymnastic
N  |||  contortions etc. An accompanying soundtrack drones
N  |||  boringly and while we might pick up a few key words
N  |||  such as "emigration, "incentive and "Man made
N  |||  that we absorb the words.. they are the music to which
N  |||  the image exercises.
E  |||  
N  |||  After a moment a series of lines cross the screen and
N  |||  the image diminishes and we realise we are looking at
N  |||  a monitor.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. BRYANT'S OFFICE (DAY)
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard and Bryant are sitting in the dark looking
N  |||  at a series of flickering monitors. Deckard has a
N  |||  bored expression on his face.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  We had an escape from the Off world
D  |||  colonies two weeks ago. Six repli-
D  |||  cants, three male, three female.
D  |||  Slaughtered twenty three people and
D  |||  jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol
D  |||  found the ship in the desert. No
D  |||  crew.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  These are old slave tapes, show me
D  |||  something new.
E  |||  
N  |||  The naked man continues to exercise as Bryant
N  |||  continues.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  No sign of them then three nights ago
D  |||  they tried to break into the Tyrell
D  |||  Corporation, one got fried going through
D  |||  an electro-field but we lost the others.
D  |||  Going on the possibibility they might
D  |||  try to infiltrate as employees, we sent
D  |||  Holden in to run Voight Kampff tests on
D  |||  new workers. Guess he found himself one.
E  |||  
N  |||  The screen changes. Roy Batty in a loin cloth is battering
N  |||  a metal post with his fists. The smile on his face
N  |||  indicates a total lack of pain. He continues to pummel
N  |||  the post mercilessly his hands becoming bloody.
N  |||  The only sound is Batty humming Beethoven's 9th.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard begins to look interested.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Who's this ?
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  It's a Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept
D  |||  date 2016, combat model optimum self
D  |||  sufficiency. Probably the leader.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Why would they come down here ?
D  |||  They coulda hid out ?
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  You tell me pal, that's what you're
D  |||  here for.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  They must want something pretty important
D  |||  to risk coming back here. What do the
D  |||  rest look like ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Bryant pushes a button. And a series of revolving still
N  |||  shots of Leon, Pris, Mary and Zhora appear on the screen.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Why the Tyrell Corporation? Why would
D  |||  they return to the place of their
D  |||  manufacture?
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Maybe they want to find out when
D  |||  they were made ?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Why would they bother?
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  The Nexus 6 was designed to copy human
D  |||  beings in every way except their emotions.
D  |||  But the makers reckoned that after a few
D  |||  years they might develop their own
D  |||  emotional responses - hate, love, fear,
D  |||  anger, envy. So they built in
D  |||  a fail safe device.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  What's that?
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  The Nexus 6 has only four years
D  |||  to live.
E  |||  
N  |||  The screens go blank. The lights go on. Bryant pours
N  |||  two more drinks and hands one to Deckard.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  You got one more problem, pal.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard downs the glass.
E  |||  
N  |||  BRYANT (continuing)
N  |||  Looks like Holden found out that
N  |||  V-K machine doesn't work on the Nexus
N  |||  6. The Tyrell Corporation has a demo
N  |||  model so go check it out. If the
N  |||  machine fails, we're in deep trouble.

M  |||  INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Small green letterforms skim soundlessly across a dark
N  |||  glass panel. Beneath the panel a sick, white face
N  |||  reads excerpts from Treasure Island, mouthing the
N  |||  words as they appear in front of him. It's Holden.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  (reading)
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden is flat on his back in a breather, an iron-
N  |||  lung-type of device covered in indicator lights and
N  |||  exotic paraphernalia. The hospital room is in com-
N  |||  plete darkness. Holden's breaths come in sharp rasps
N  |||  as he reads.
E  |||  
N  |||  We become aware of Deckard standing in the shadows.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Whatcha reading?
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden is startled, has to look in a mirror angled over
N  |||  his head, rolling his eyes way back to see who it is.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Deckard, Treasure Island! Good to
D  |||  see ya, buddy. Old Favourite.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks down at Holden and doesn't say anything.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Pretty awful, huh?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Naw, you look great! Absolutely
D  |||  terrific! Never saw ya look
D  |||  better. Jesus, you look good.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard pinches Holden's cheek.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Great complexion! Suit looks
D  |||  really nice. Who's your tailor?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is making a joke, mocking hospital good cheer
N  |||  but the touch of bitterness in his voice reveals his
N  |||  sympathy for Holden.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tears wet Holden's eyes.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  A big fucking skin job put the
D  |||  smash on me, wrecked me up! Looka
D  |||  me, for Chrissake!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard works at being hard.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Ya blew it, huh ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden recovers from his tears and whines.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  It ain't like it used to be, Deck.
D  |||  It's tough now. These replicants
D  |||  aren't just a buncha muscle miners
D  |||  anymore, they're no goddamn different
D  |||  than you or me...
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard lights up and sits down, resting his elbows on
N  |||  the glass.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  So what happened ?
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Ten days ago Security at the
D  |||  Tyrell Corp finds three intruders
D  |||  in the records room. Kills one,
D  |||  two get away, okay ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard nods.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  They do a routine autopsy on the
D  |||  one that got aired and.. whaddya know?
D  |||  A skin job, one of the ones that
D  |||  busted out! Top drawer replicant..
D  |||  combat type.. Nexus six.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Pretty sexy, the sixes.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Sexy! Three hours into the autopsy
D  |||  they still think they're cutting
D  |||  up a human. No marks, nothing.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks impressed. Satisfied, Holden continues.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  I decided to check out all new employees
D  |||  at Tyrell. I test 26 boring jerks until
D  |||  in comes this guy Leon Somebody, nothing
D  |||  special but very big...
D  |||  (pause)
D  |||  Anyway....
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You Voight-Kampff him ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden's eyes flutter a moment. Deckard waits. The
N  |||  breathing changes rhythm.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Yeah! I thought maybe I was getting
D  |||  something......
D  |||  Maybe it doesn't work on these ones
D  |||  Deck.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard gets up and gives Holden phony good cheer.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  It's all over, it's a wipe out,
D  |||  they're almost us, Deck, they're
D  |||  a disease, they're....
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Take it easy, take it easy....
D  |||  Tyrell Corp's got one. I'm gonna
D  |||  Vee Kay it tomorrow.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Push it! Push that button!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard pushes.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  What's it for?

M  |||  INT. SPINNER - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff is terse and silent at the controls. Suddenly the
N  |||  spinner rocks urgently from side to side and the sound
N  |||  of a hot Ferrari Spinner dopplers off.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff is pop-eyed with instant fury. He hits the spinner

D  |||  Replicants are like any other

D  |||  May I ask a personal question?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Go ahead.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Have you ever retired a human by
D  |||  mistake ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard blinks... hesitates before answering the
N  |||  question.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  No.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  But in your position that is a risk.
E  |||  
N  |||  An OWL flaps around the huge marble office.
E  |||  
N  |||  TYRELL (os)
N  |||  Is this to be an empathy test?
N  |||  Capillary dilation of the so-called

E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard turns to see an older man, very distinguished
N  |||  very well tailored has entered the huge marble office.
C  |||  TYRELL!
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Mr. Deckard. Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell has extended his hand to Deckard. Deckard shakes.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Demonstrate it. I want to see it
D  |||  work.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Where's the prototype ?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  I want to see it work on a person.
D  |||  I want to see a negative before I
D  |||  provide you with a positive.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  What's that gonna prove?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Indulge me.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  On you?
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell indicates Rachael.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Try her.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks at Rachael. She's a beauty alright. He
N  |||  shrugs.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  It's too bright in here.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell hits a button.
E  |||  
N  |||  The windows darken, a polaroid effect that seems to
N  |||  give Tyrell the power to turn off the sun.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is placing the Voight Kampff case on the table.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Voight Kampff opens like a butterfly as the room
N  |||  darkens.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. TYRELL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant,
N  |||  shot with light, the pupil contracting. We hear
N  |||  Deckard's voice and we have the impression the test
N  |||  has been going on for a while.
E  |||  
M  |||  DECKARD (O.S.)
M  |||  You are given a calfskin wallet
M  |||  for your birthday...
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell stands silhouetted behind Deckard, who sits in
N  |||  front of Rachael.
E  |||  
N  |||  The needles in both gauges swing violently past green
N  |||  to red, then subside.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I wouldn't accept it, also I'd
D  |||  report the person who gave it to me
D  |||  to the police.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You have a little boy. He shows
D  |||  you his butterfly collection, plus
D  |||  the killing jar.
E  |||  
N  |||  Again the gauges register, but not so far.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I'd take him to the doctor.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You're watching TV and suddenly
D  |||  you notice a wasp crawling on
D  |||  your wrist.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I'd kill it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Both needles go red. Deckard makes a note, takes a
N  |||  sip of coffee and continues.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  In a magazine you come across a
D  |||  full-page photo of a nude girl.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Is this testing whether I'm a
D  |||  replicant or a lesbian?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You show the pciture to your
D  |||  husband. He likes it and hangs
D  |||  it on the wall. The girl is lying
D  |||  on a bearskin rug.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I wouldn't let him.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Why not?
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I should be enough for him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard frowns, then smiles. His smile looks a little
N  |||  like a grimace or the other way around.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Last question. You're watching
D  |||  an old movie. It shows a banquet
D  |||  in progress, the guests are enjoying
D  |||  raw oysters.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Ugh.
E  |||  
N  |||  Both needles swing swiftly.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  The entree consists of boiled
D  |||  dog stuffed with rice.
E  |||  
N  |||  Needles move less.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  The raw oysters are less acceptable
D  |||  to you than a dish of boiled dog.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard switches off his beam.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Well, Mr. Deckard?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is looking at Tyrell and wincing indecisively.
E  |||  
N  |||  He doesn't get it. Are they playing with him?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  (continuing)
D  |||  Perhaps some privacy will loosen
D  |||  your tongue, Mr. Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  He turns to Rachael
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Would you step out for a few moments,
D  |||  Rachael?
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael exits looking a little shaken. What's going
N  |||  on?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stares at Tyrell.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell meets his look.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  I'm impressed. How many questions
D  |||  does it usually take to spot one?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I don't get it.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  How many questions ?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  In columns of four cross referenced,
D  |||  twenty or thirty.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  It took more than a hundred for
D  |||  Rachael, didn't it ?

C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  She's beginning to suspect, I think.

C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Suspect! How can she not know
D  |||  she is.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Well, we began to notice in them
D  |||  a strange obsession.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell is pacing now, lecturing.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  After all, they are emotionally
D  |||  inexperienced with only a few
D  |||  years inwhich to store up the
D  |||  experiences which you and I take
D  |||  for granted. If we gift them
D  |||  with a past... we create a
D  |||  cushion or pillow for their
D  |||  emotions.. and we can
D  |||  control them better.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  They want memories?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  It's the dark corners, the little
D  |||  shadowy places that makes you
D  |||  interesting, Deckard..... gusty
D  |||  emotions on a wet road on an
D  |||  autumn night.. the change of
D  |||  seasons..... the sweet guilt
D  |||  after masturbation.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Jesus Christ,Tyrell!
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell looks startled.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Where do you get them, the
D  |||  memories?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  In the case of Rachael, I simply
D  |||  copied and regenerated cells from
D  |||  the brain of my sixteen-year-
D  |||  old niece. Rachael remembers
D  |||  what my little niece remembers.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I saw an old movie once. The
D  |||  guy had bolts in his head.
E  |||

N  |||  himself.

E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard glances at a crumpled piece of paper in his
N  |||  hand with an address scrawled on it.

N  |||  Deckard studies the shadows, weapon ready.
E  |||  
N  |||  Satisfied the room is empty, he hits the wall switch.
E  |||  
N  |||  A four-tube fluorescent light overhead flutters weakly
N  |||  to half-life, two tubes.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard studies the room.
E  |||  
N  |||  It's clean in contrast to the littered hallway. A bed,
N  |||  a wardrobe, a small desk, a chair. Spartan, almost
N  |||  military.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff has seated himself on the windowsill. Except for
N  |||  his eyes he is motionless like a statue.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard reaches into his pocket and takes out infrared
N  |||  goggles which he puts on. He looks strange wearing the
N  |||  goggles.
E  |||  
N  |||  The room, from his POV, is seen in high contrast,
N  |||  every speck of dust in bright white, the fingerprints
N  |||  on the wall standing out like paintings, Gaff appear-
N  |||  ing eerie and ominous.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard starts to inspect the room with great care,
N  |||  feeling the moulding, inspecting the mattress on the
N  |||  bed, studying the fingerprints on the wall.

N  |||  He's inspecting the suit neatly hung there. He feels
N  |||  in the pockets. He pulls out a packet of about sixty
N  |||  photographs. He thumbs them. Very ordinary looking
N  |||  snapshots. Maybe he notices a couple of strange ones.
N  |||  Maybe not.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard pockets the pictures and continues his inspec-

N  |||  Nothing. Clean.

N  |||  instructor, short, cropped hair with the body of a

N  |||  Roy Batty is a presence of force with a lazy, but
N  |||  acute sense of what goes on around him.

D  |||  He's very proud of them. He ran them
D  |||  on a scanner for me.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael just stares at him, stunned and barely holding on.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Still don't believe me ?
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I... I...
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Right. I made it all up. You're not
D  |||  a replicant. It was a nasty joke. Go home.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael is biting her lip or something, holding it back.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Go on. Beat it. Sorry. Bad joke.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard sees he's gotten through... maybe too far.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Wanna drink ?
E  |||  
N  |||  She's completely destroyed, silent.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I'll getcha one.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard hurries out.

M  |||  INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is peering at her from the doorway, a Peeping
N  |||  Tom. He sees the shaking hands. He doesn't like this
N  |||  shit.
E  |||  
N  |||  He turns his attention to getting the drink. The
N  |||  kitchen is a disaster area, dirty dishes overflowing
N  |||  from the sink the way a plant grows out of a pot.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard opens the refrigerator. The contents aren't
N  |||  messy so much as unusual. He opens the freezer com-
N  |||  partment and pulls out a bottle of Tsing Tao vodka
N  |||  and eyes it. Half-empty.
E  |||  
N  |||  He rummages among the dirty dishes for a glass that
N  |||  doesn't actually have fungus growing in it. He finds
N  |||  one that's only greasy, wipes it with a dirty towel
N  |||  (making it greasier) and pours vodka into it.
E  |||  
N  |||  He heads back into the living room.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stops in the doorway,surprised.
E  |||  
N  |||  The room is empty. Rachael is gone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stares at the empty room for a long moment. Then
N  |||  he chug-a-lugs the vodka. As he brings his head back and
N  |||  winces from the fiery booze he sees something.
E  |||  
N  |||  Something crumpled on the floor.
E  |||  
N  |||  He goes over and picks it up.
E  |||  
N  |||  It's the picture of Rachael with her parents. He studies
N  |||  it.
E  |||  
N  |||  On the other side is a phone number.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard walks over to the window and stares out.
E  |||  
N  |||  A spinner flashes by smearing light on his face.

N  |||  A spinner rockets past overhead. She reacts nervously
N  |||  watches the spinner slide away.
E  |||  
N  |||  She crosses the street past a window full of wedding dresses
N  |||  as the spinner zips off in the distance.

M  |||  EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris walks under the art deco marquee between the twisted
N  |||  corduroy columns and into the foyer.
E  |||  
N  |||  She picks a spot near the entrance and is covering herself with
N  |||  old newspapers and trash for warmth when she hears a strange
C  |||  NOISE.
E  |||  
N  |||  A weird street cleaning MACHINE GRINDS past.
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris watches the machine with interest, then huddles
N  |||  under the trash.
E  |||  
N  |||  A battered old truck, Sebastian's, SPUTTER AND FARTS
N  |||  to a halt in front.
E  |||  
N  |||  SEBASTIAN gets out, a young man with skin that is yel-
N  |||  lowing into old parchment. He's wearing a World War
N  |||  Two leather pilot's cap and dark goggles and carrying
N  |||  a pack.
E  |||  
N  |||  In spite of his youth, he carries himself like Old
N  |||  China as he walks toward the entrance with the gait
N  |||  of an old man.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian stumbles over the trash covered body of Pris
N  |||  and Pris leaps to her feet and start to run like a
N  |||  frightened gazelle.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Hey!
E  |||  
N  |||  He reaches down and picks up the bag she left in the
N  |||  trash.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  You forgot your bag.
E  |||  
N  |||  He's holding it up.
E  |||  
N  |||  She eyes him from a distance... unsure of him. Then
N  |||  she moves toward him tentatively.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian smiles awkwardly and holds out the bag.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  I'm lost.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Both of them are silent. People are not Sebastian's
N  |||  forte... usually he's too shy, but this girl is shyer
N  |||  still. Plus they're about the same age... it gives
N  |||  him courage.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  What's your name?
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  Pris.

D  |||  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  Hi.
E  |||  
N  |||  So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
N  |||  while what comes next.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Oh... where were you going?
E  |||  
N  |||  She shrugs. That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
N  |||  He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Home?
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  I don't have one.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Oh.
E  |||  
N  |||  She looks at him, a shadow of enticement in her clear
N  |||  blue eyes.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  We scared each other pretty good,
D  |||  didn't we?
E  |||

D  |||  We sure did.
E  |||  
N  |||  She giggles and laughs.

C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  I was hoping you'd say that.

M  |||  INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  A blurry photograph, unclear, FILLS THE SCREEN.
E  |||  
N  |||  The photograph intensified. The foreground BLURS AND
N  |||  SHARPENS. it's the "man" in Leon's room with the
N  |||  wardrobe behind him. The head is turned away and
N  |||  downward, the face unreadable.
E  |||  
N  |||  Another change! A dramatic one. The picture is
N  |||  suddenly three dimensional.
E  |||  
N  |||  Now we see that Deckard is studying the picture in a
N  |||  viewer controlling the effects with punch controls.
E  |||  
N  |||  The ashtray next to him is full of butts. The bottle
N  |||  of vodka is nearly empty.
E  |||  
N  |||  He sucks on his cigarette and empties the vodka bottle
N  |||  into his glass and goes back to peering into the
N  |||  viewer.
E  |||  
N  |||  He punches up.
E  |||  
N  |||  A transparent grid with vectors is superimposed over
N  |||  the photo.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's eyes move over it carefully.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Sharpen line forty-eight between
D  |||  twenty point twenty-seven.
E  |||  
N  |||  The edge of the man sharpens.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Profile trace.
E  |||  
N  |||  Slowly the view tracks the periphery of the man's
N  |||  shoulder, up and around the skull, down the other
N  |||  side and as it approaches the bottom of the picture
N  |||  passes a miniscule sparkle...
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Stop. Back up.
E  |||  
N  |||  The line is retraced.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Stop.
E  |||  
N  |||  The faintest little sparkle. Static. Almost nothing.
N  |||  Deckard leans forward.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Enhance.
E  |||  
N  |||  The view squeezes in. The "spark" seems to be coming
N  |||  from about fifteen feet behind the figure -- from
N  |||  within the wardrobe.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Seesaw.
E  |||  
N  |||  After a short pause, as if the command causes the
N  |||  machine to strain, it emits a thin, high-pitched
N  |||  FREQUENCY SOUND and the picture begins a horizontal
N  |||  yawing motion. As it swings back and forth glimpses
N  |||  of things previously obscured by the foreground
N  |||  figure are revealed. Slightly at first, but the
N  |||  opening grows as the process picks up momentum.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's right down there, hands on his knees like
N  |||  a man watching his favorite team make a crucial play.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Stop!
E  |||  
N  |||  The picture freezes.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Enhance.
E  |||  
N  |||  The view pushes in to the wardrobe. In its gloomy
N  |||  recesses hangs a dress.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Enhance.
E  |||  
N  |||  In closer on the dress. An exotic shimmering gown
N  |||  made of sequins. Deckard ponders it, smiles slightly.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I don't suppose one of those males
D  |||  has a transvestite problem.
E  |||  
N  |||  Pause.
E  |||

D  |||  Hey!
E  |||  
N  |||  Esper wakes up.
E  |||

D  |||  Negative.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard considers the situation for a few moments,
N  |||  then frowns thoughtfully and fishes his wallet out of
N  |||  his pocket. He produces the flakes he found in the
N  |||  hotel room.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard lights a cigarette.
E  |||  
N  |||  The flake.
E  |||  
N  |||  He's holding it on the tip of his finger under the
N  |||  light of the console screen. He sits down, studying
N  |||  it like Hamlet, contemplating Yorick's skull. But
N  |||  for the HUM OF THE MACHINE, a long silence.
E  |||  
C  |||  ESPER
D  |||  You're gonna have a fire if you
D  |||  don't turn off the machine.
E  |||

N  |||  sits a while in the silent dark. Then goes into the
N  |||  bathroom.

N  |||  jabber in Kangaroo, a crude lingual mix of Chinese,
N  |||  Japanese, French and Tagalog.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is hunched over his bowl of noodles, slurping
N  |||  hungrily from his busy chopsticks.
E  |||  
N  |||  Whap! The counterman slaps a serving of fish heads on
N  |||  the counter in front of a CHINESE sitting next to
N  |||  Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Startled by the sound Deckard glances at the bowl of
N  |||  fish heads, then turns his attention back to his
N  |||  noodles.
E  |||  
N  |||  But after two bites he frowns and turns to look at
N  |||  the fish heads again.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Chinese is eating the flesh hungrily from a head.
N  |||  He cleans the skull and drops it on the plate.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stares at the heads with their blank stares
N  |||  that seem to gaze at eternity.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is thinking.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Chinese is eating.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard frowns lost in furious thought. Suddenly he
N  |||  reaches out and grabs a fish head.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Chinese goes bug-eyed with indignation.

E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  What helps you to remember ?
E  |||  
N  |||  The Egyptian pushes a hand out in front of him, revolving
N  |||  the thumb slowly against the next two fingers.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard slips a card out of his pocket and into the
N  |||  man's fingers. It's a police card. It gets a super-
N  |||  cilious smile, a sigh and a shrug. And that's all
N  |||  it gets. The man knows his rights. The card is
N  |||  handed back. The smile remains.
E  |||

D  |||  Fire permit?
E  |||  
C  |||  EGYPTIAN
D  |||  Right here.
E  |||  
N  |||  He lifts it out of a drawer, displays it. A long
N  |||  pause. The Egyptian smiles smugly. It pays to have
N  |||  things covered. Deckard pushes closer.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  In two seconds I'm gonna break
D  |||  your fuckin' spine if you don't

D  |||  have done this.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Who ?
E  |||  
C  |||  EGYPTIAN
D  |||  Me.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Egyptian works on an uncertain shit-eating grin
N  |||  hoping to charm his way out of a hole.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard lets him sweat for a beat or two, looking hard.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Who do you sell your junk to .
E  |||  
C  |||  EGYPTIAN
D  |||  Artists. Always to artists.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Eygptian looks nervously at Deckard,sees he
N  |||  means business and hastily begins to shuffle through a
N  |||  wad of receipts from a cigar box.
E  |||

E  |||  
M  |||  INT. TAFFEY'S SNAKE PIT BAR - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  A big guy, back to camera is sitting at the bar in
N  |||  this sleazy joint.
E  |||  
M  |||  DECKARD (OS)
M  |||  You buy a snake off an Egyptian ?
E  |||  
N  |||  The big guy turns to face his questioner. His name
N  |||  is TAFFEY LEWIS big and bad and low-life. He looks
N  |||  like he's looking at a cockroach.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Buzz off, fella.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is searching in his pockets. He pulls a dirty
N  |||  handkerchief out, puts it on the bar, pulls out a
N  |||  crumpled pack of cigs from another pocket, a wad of
N  |||  money cards from another. He's putting all sorts of
N  |||  things on the bar. Among them is the picture of
N  |||  Rachael and her parents.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You ever see..... you ever se... ?
E  |||  
N  |||  At last he finds the photo of the reclining woman, shows
N  |||  it to Taffey.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You ever see this woman ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Taffey doesn't even look at the picture.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Never saw her. Buzz off,pal.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard flashes his police card.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Got your licenses in order, old
D  |||  buddy ?
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Pal, I got a license to piss,
D  |||  I got a license to kiss,
D  |||  An' I got a license to pee at
D  |||  four in the morning.
E  |||  
N  |||  I got licenses for things I do with
N  |||  my wife an' I got licenses for things
N  |||  I don't do with my wife.
E  |||  
N  |||  I got licenses for bad dreams, pal.
N  |||  I got licenses you wouldn't believe.
N  |||  Now buzz the fuck off, okay ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard seems blown away, puts his hands up, palms forward,
N  |||  surrendering.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Take it easy mister, don't get
D  |||  excited.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Nobody pushes me around.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Forget I asked. My mistake.
D  |||  Water under the bridge.
E  |||  
N  |||  Taffey looks a little startled. It was this easy ? He's
N  |||  kind of pleased with himself now that he's firmly estab-
N  |||  lished his authority.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  No hard feelings. I just don't
D  |||  take a push, that's all.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  No hard feelings.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  (to the bartender)
D  |||  Louis, the man's dry. Give him
D  |||  one on the house, huh ?
E  |||  
C  |||  BARTENDER
D  |||  Whatcha drinking ?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Smokey, dry.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  You assed about a snake.....
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is suddenly hopeful.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Yeah.....
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Wanna see a snake, huh?
E  |||  
N  |||  The Bartender puts a weird drink in front of Deckard...
N  |||  tiny worms floating in a viscous liquid.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard takes the drink like he was used to it and swigs.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Louis, show the cop the snake,
D  |||  willya?
E  |||  
N  |||  The Bartender reaches under the bar and pulls out a
N  |||  large snake that writhes lazily on the bar. It is
N  |||  bright gold.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  (disappointed)
D  |||  Wrong snake.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Don't like gold ?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Gold's okay.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Original paint job was shitty. Those
D  |||  fucking Egyptian's do crappy work.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  How long ago did ya paint it?
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  I dunno. Couple of months.
D  |||  Why ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks discouraged, swigs the last of his drink.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  No reason. Doesn't matter.
D  |||  (to the bartender)
D  |||  Gimmee another, willya?
E  |||  
N  |||  There is a burst of applause and they all look around
N  |||  toward the stage.
E  |||  
N  |||  A large egg has appeared on the stage, beside it a
N  |||  smaller egg.
E  |||  
C  |||  TAFFEY
D  |||  Getta loada this. New act.
D  |||  Very artistic, very sen-shoe-all.
D  |||  Beautiful.
E  |||  
N  |||  Music starts to play.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks bored and discouraged. Absently starts
N  |||  picking up his junk off the bar... the wads of money cards,
N  |||  cigarette packs, matches... the picture of Rachael. That
N  |||  catches his attention.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stares at the picture for a long moment.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Gotta phone ?
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. TAFFEY'S BAR MOMENTS LATER
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is at a telephone not far from the bar. He's
N  |||  got the phone hooked between his shoulder and ear while
N  |||  he notes a number.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  .......six six five. Thanks.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard breaks the connection, then starts punching the
N  |||  numbers.
E  |||  
N  |||  Behind him the stage show is progressing. A beautiful
N  |||  woman named SALOME is emerging from the large egg, very
N  |||  scantily clad, an erotic birth scene.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael appears on the telephone vid-screen.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Hello.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  People have walked out on me
D  |||  before... but never when I was
D  |||  being charming.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael freezes when she see who it is. Says nothing.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Ya missed out on the drink I
D  |||  poured ya.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael still says nothing.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Wanna try again ?
E  |||  
N  |||  For a long moment it seems Rachael isn't going to say
N  |||  anything.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael is bitter.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  (on Vid-screen)
D  |||  Hunting... "skin jobs "?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Didn't find any.All I found was a bar.
D  |||  Why waste it ?
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  (on vid-screen)
D  |||  Not my kind of place I'm afraid.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Meet me here. We'll go someplace
D  |||  else. It's in the Fourth Sector....
E  |||  
N  |||  Something on the stage catches Deckard's eye. He frowns.
E  |||  
N  |||  On stage, a snake has emerged from the second egg.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is suddenly pre-occupied with the stage show as
N  |||  he absently gives the address over the phone.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  ...... the Fourth Sector, on the line.
D  |||  Taffey Lewis' Snake Pit.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I don't think so Mr. Deckard.
D  |||  As I said......
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is staring at the stage show.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  (absently)
D  |||  See ya in a half hour.
E  |||  
N  |||  He hangs up.
E  |||  
N  |||  On stage, the snake and Salome are into sexy stuff.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. BACKSTAGE A LITTLE LATER
E  |||  
N  |||  You can hear applause and catcalls from the audience
N  |||  as Salome flounces backstage. She starts toward the
N  |||  dressing room.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard emerges from the shadow.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Excuse me, Miss Salome....
E  |||  
N  |||  She turns. Deckard's posture and attitude suggest humble,
N  |||  sleazy persistence. He comes closer with his shit-eating
N  |||  grin.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I'd like to have a word with you
D  |||  if I could.
E  |||  
N  |||  Salome stands almost six feet tall in her high heels and
N  |||  looks down on him with haughty suspicion... a girl who
N  |||  knows how to handle cheap hits.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  Yeah ?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I'm with the American Federation of
D  |||  Variety Artists....
E  |||  
N  |||  He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Don't worry, I'm not here to
D  |||  make you join... that's not my department.
E  |||  
N  |||  He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
N  |||  there.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I'm an investigator for the Confidential
D  |||  Committee on Moral Abuses.
E  |||  
N  |||  She nods, taking it a little more seriously.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  There's been reports of the
D  |||  management taking liberties with
D  |||  the artists in this place.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  I don't know nothing about it.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You haven't felt yourself to be
D  |||  exploited by the management in
D  |||  any way?
E  |||  
N  |||  She's definitely puzzled.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  How do you mean 'exploited'?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Like to get this job... did you
D  |||  or were you asked to do anything
D  |||  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
D  |||  repulsive to your person?
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  Are you for real?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised
D  |||  what goes on around here. I'd
D  |||  like to check the dressing room
D  |||  if I could.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  What the fuck for?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  For holes.
E  |||  
N  |||  This guy might be an asshole, but he's funny.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  I don't believe this.
E  |||  
N  |||  She shrugs and they go in.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Musty, cramped. A portable shower, a dressing table
N  |||  and not much else. On the dressing table lies a snake.
N  |||  Deckard watches it undulate into the warmth of the
N  |||  lights.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Is that mother for real ?
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  Of course he's not real. You think
D  |||  I'd be working here if I could afford
D  |||  a real snake ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard reaches out to touch it. As his fingers make
N  |||  contact, there's an electric "snap". he jerks his hand
N  |||  back from the shock.
E  |||  
N  |||  Salome is taking off her costume. There's not much to
N  |||  take off.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard gets a glimpse of nakedness as she slips behind
N  |||  the screen and turns on the shower.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  How long you been doing a snake act ?
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  What is it with you... you looking for
D  |||  holes or what ?
E  |||  
N  |||  He starts pacing the room like's he's inspecting the walls.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You'd be surprised - they have their ways
D  |||  of doing their dirty work without the victim
D  |||  even knowing what's going on.
E  |||  
N  |||  His fingers are moving over her gowns. There's about six of
N  |||  them, on hangers, but nothing quite like the one in Leon's
N  |||  closet.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through
D  |||  to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  No, I wouldn't.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Little dirty holes they drill in the wall
D  |||  so they can watch a lady undress.
E  |||  
N  |||  And to his amazement, low on the wall, behind the dresses,
N  |||  he actually spots one. He moves down for a peek.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  And what if somebody did try to "exploit"
D  |||  me? Who do I go to ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's peeking at a pair of fat legs in the next room.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Me.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  And who do I go to about you ?
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks around... she's out of the shower dripping nude.
N  |||  Her hair blonde and cropped short. Her black hair is a wig
N  |||  which now hangs on the wall next to the shower. She didn't
N  |||  look like Nexus designated Zhora to begin with, but even less
N  |||  now.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  So did you find any holes ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard makes a sheepish grin.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  One so far.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  You're a dedicated man.
E  |||  
N  |||  Her smile is an invitation. She throws him a towel.
N  |||  He catches it and she turns her back to him.
E  |||  
C  |||  SALOME
D  |||  Dry me.
E  |||  
N  |||  The evening doesn't have to be a total waste. Deckard
N  |||  steps up behind her and starts patting her down.
E  |||  
N  |||  On the dressing table in front of them the python
N  |||  noses through the cosmetics, tongue flicking, trying
N  |||  to get back to its mistress. Caught up in the sensu-
N  |||  ousness of the moment, absently she reaches out to
N  |||  stroke the snake.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard works his way down her back, over her buns and
N  |||  as he reaches her thighs, sits on the cot. Concen-
N  |||  trating on her buns, he leans back for a handier per-
N  |||  spective. But jerks forward like he'd been stung as
N  |||  his ears are hit with the BUZZ OF RATTLES directly be-
N  |||  hind him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Partly hidden behind the pillow against the wall is
N  |||  the Egyptian's pride and joy, a four-and-a-half foot,
N  |||  ring-tailed diamondback rattler. Its lethal looking
N  |||  spade-shaped head elevated out of its coiled body,
N  |||  tail erect and whirring madly.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard rolls off the cot going for his blaster as he
N  |||  hits the floor. SALOME/ZHORA has her hand around the
N  |||  head of the python and, using it like a club, she
N  |||  brings it down with all her might.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard rolls out of the way as the SNAKE WHISTLES
N  |||  through the air with such force, it ruptures as it
N  |||  hits the floor.
E  |||  
N  |||  If Deckard's fast, Zhora's a blur. As he FIRES, her
N  |||  foot kicks into his groin, and he doubles up with the
N  |||  pain of it. He tries for a second shot but she's al-
N  |||  ready out the door carrying a raincoat.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Bottom lip between his teeth, Deckard hops out of the
N  |||  dressing room in time to see her go through the door at
N  |||  the other end of the hall.
E  |||  
N  |||  It hurts to move so fast, but he jack-legs after her,
N  |||  arrives at the door and flings it open. Blackness.
N  |||  The SOUND OF HER HIGH HEELS CLATTER down the metal
N  |||  steps.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  It's RAINING HEAVILY.
E  |||  
N  |||  The front of the Opera House is open only to foot
N  |||  traffic these days. A bizarre place on a Friday night,
N  |||  hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the curi-
N  |||  ous mill around the crudely built platforms and
N  |||  brightly lit stands. Zhora, in just a translucent
N  |||  raincoat, is not out of place in this flea market at-
N  |||  mosphere. Trying not to run, she slices through the
N  |||  mob as quickly as she can. Deckard is not far behind,
N  |||  dodging and side-stepping, trying to move against the
N  |||  tide of people scurrying for shelter.
E  |||  
N  |||  She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
N  |||  onto a less crowded street. She glances over her
N  |||  shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
N  |||  a couple of pedestrians. All three go down.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
N  |||  ting to her feet. She sees him and runs. The two
N  |||  pedestrians are in his line of fire. He runs past
N  |||  them and drops to one knee, leveling his blaster.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Stop or you're dead!
E  |||  
N  |||  She doesn't.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard OPENS UP, squeezing off two quick misses.
E  |||  
N  |||  WHAP! The corner of the building disintegrates --
N  |||  bricks imploding, dust in the air.
E  |||  
N  |||  FWAAAP! Another miss! A lamppost wrenched with a
N  |||  tight air implosion. Twisted metal, a breath of smoke.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard FIRES again!
E  |||  
N  |||  WHUMP! Zhora takes a hit in the back of the head, and
N  |||  that's it for her except her motor reflexes which keep
N  |||  her going right into a showcase window.
E  |||  
N  |||  CRASH! Zhora explodes through a series of plate glass
N  |||  windows in adjoining shops.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is trying to pour FIRE through the tunnel of her
N  |||  jagged wake, but after TWO MISSES his blaster CLICKS
N  |||  empty, CLICKS empty, CLICKS empty and he watches her
N  |||  go.
E  |||  
N  |||  Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
N  |||  sliced, already shot, running on reflexes. Glass
N  |||  sprays like fireworks as she smashes through the last
N  |||  two windows and into the street. She's going too fast
N  |||  to stop.
E  |||  
N  |||  She hits a passing bus so hard she's smeared all over the
N  |||  side like a mural and the bus squeals to a halt.
E  |||  
N  |||  The rain has stopped and turned into a quiet DRIZZLE.
N  |||  WATER GURGLING down the gutters.
E  |||  
N  |||  Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly
N  |||  forward. The crowd starting to gather. Something here
N  |||  for everybody as they're coming from all directions.
N  |||  Deckard moves through them, ending up to the side of
N  |||  the bus.
E  |||  
N  |||  Zhora is wedged on her side, torn, bloody and broken.
N  |||  All she can move is her eyes -- they dart about like
N  |||  a wounded animal doomed in a trap and stop on
N  |||  Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  He's kneeled in the street, stooped low, head cocked at
N  |||  an awkward angle looking back at her.
E  |||  
N  |||  In the cramped and dripping darkness her eyes are turn-
N  |||  ing glassy. The intervals between the FALLING DROPS OF
N  |||  WATER accentuate the silence until there is no dripping
N  |||  and even the gurgling gutters have receded into silence
N  |||  as the life drains out of Zhora's face until it's
N  |||  frozen, dead.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's eyes slowly follow the rivulets of blood that
N  |||  lead over the slope of a blacktop to his shoes. Deckard
N  |||  tries to repress his wince. His eyes reveal that it's
N  |||  getting to him. He's aware of the spectators around
N  |||  him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Looking up, he sees them moving nervously away from
N  |||  him with frightened looks.
E  |||  
N  |||  Then he sees her. Rachael is standing in the crowd
N  |||  staring at the dead Zhora.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael's face reveals her horror. She looks from Zhora
N  |||  to Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard feels her eyes burn into him. He clicks his empty
N  |||  pistol stupidly. CLICK CLICK.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lights from a spinner smear over the crowd, sirens whine.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard sees Rachael disappear into the crowd.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard starts to say something but anything he said would
N  |||  be drowned in siren noise.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael is swallowed up into the crowd near a big sign
N  |||  (or some other distinctive landmark).
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. THE CROWD - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon and Batty are just faces in the throng of ASIANS
N  |||  and LATINOS. They too see the body of Zhora.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty and Leon look very grim.
E  |||  
N  |||  They turn their attention to Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  From their point of view they see a pantomime out of ear
N  |||  shot.... Deckard hastily flashes his badge at arriving
N  |||  COPS, points to Zhora, gives a couple of instructions and
N  |||  hurries off, passing under the big sign, leaving the cops
N  |||  to stare after him with amazement.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty and Leon exchange a look. Batty makes a head movement.
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon heads off toward the big sign.

E  |||  
N  |||  The tide of STREET PEOPLE moves inexorbaly as Deckard,
N  |||  like a swimmer, moves through them, eyes busy, searching
N  |||  for Rachael.
E  |||  
N  |||  Thinks he sees her.
E  |||  
N  |||  Shoves his way through the crowd.
E  |||  
N  |||  Not her.
E  |||  
N  |||  Looks around in dispair.
E  |||  
N  |||  Catches sight of her half a block away.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard hurries after her. Calls out.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Rachael. Wait.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael looks back, sees him.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Hold on.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael keeps going.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is hurrying past the mouth of an alley. Suddenly
N  |||  he's being hurried into the alley.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Hey.
E  |||  
N  |||  A big guy is collaring him and hauling him into the alley.
E  |||

M  |||  EXT. ALLEY NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  A family of SAMOANS look up from their dismal cooking
N  |||  fire in the alley.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Hey, what the hell, buddy!
E  |||  
N  |||  The Samoan's faces are blank. They stick by the fire and
N  |||  express no feelings anout the events in the alley.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in
N  |||  Leon's bear-trap embrace.
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
N  |||  hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he
N  |||  rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon
N  |||  is so fast he's already there and kicks it out of his
N  |||  hand.
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the
N  |||  wall.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  How come you knew where Zhora was
D  |||  so quick?
E  |||  
N  |||  His hand is like lightning. It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
N  |||  hair.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I showed pictures. Somebody
D  |||  recognized her. I went to see.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is pale. The sweat is starting to run.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  How old am I?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I don't know.
E  |||  
N  |||  The grip tightens and twists.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  My birthday is April 10, 2017.
D  |||  How long do I live?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Four years.
E  |||  
N  |||  He lets go.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  More than you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's knees come up fast, but Leon's fist comes down
N  |||  faster, like a hammer.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  But that's how it is to be a slave.
D  |||  The future is sealed off, he
D  |||  grovels, he waits.
E  |||  
N  |||  Even hurt, Deckard is fast. He goes for his ankle gun,
N  |||  but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
N  |||  raise it and throws it down the alley.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
N  |||  scrambles to get away. Leon grabs him by the foot,
N  |||  drags him back and jerks him off the ground.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Sex, reproduction, security, the
D  |||  simple things. But no way to
D  |||  satisfy them. To be homesick
D  |||  with no place to go. Potential
D  |||  with no way to use it. Lots of
D  |||  little oversights in the Nexus
D  |||  Six.
E  |||  
N  |||  He slams Deckard into the wall.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  I tell you, nothing is worse than
D  |||  having an itch you can never scratch.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles
N  |||  protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the
N  |||  next one.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I agree with you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
N  |||  his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
N  |||  tion of smashing Deckard's skull.
E  |||  
C  |||  LEON
D  |||  Too late. Your mistake.
E  |||  
N  |||  The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
N  |||  satisfaction. It's the bullet that went through his
N  |||  neck. He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
N  |||  the air like a rabid dog. Dead.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard has slumped to the ground where he sits propped
N  |||  into a sitting position by the wall, staring up in
N  |||  amazement at his deliverer.
E  |||  
N  |||  He sees Rachael standing there with his blaster,
N  |||  Rachael is staring at the body of Leon, stunned and
N  |||  shaken at what she has done.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks up at her, his eyes swollen into slits,
N  |||  his mouth and nose bloody. He sees how shaken she is.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael turns and looks at him. Their eyes meet.
N  |||  She drops the blaster.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard gets painfully to his feet, picks up the
N  |||  blaster and starts to reload it. He doesn't make the
N  |||  same mistake twice. He glances at her.
E  |||  
N  |||  Again their eyes meet.

N  |||  place.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard and Rachaek are walking together, almost
N  |||  zombies.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is only a little less bloody and a lot more
N  |||  swollen.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael looks stoned on the horror of the killing.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  There's only one thing that works
D  |||  on cuts and bruises and long nights.
E  |||

N  |||  It's a grimy little tienda with a counter right on the
N  |||  sidewalk and shelves crammed with dusty bottles,
N  |||  bright packs of cigarettes, old magazines and assorted
N  |||  junk. The SALESLADY wears an eyepatch and a sharp look
N  |||  in her good eye.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard and Rachael are facing her.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Tsing Tao.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Saleslady tries to hand Deckard a half pint but he
N  |||  shakes his head and points and she produces a fifth.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is paying when he feels a tap on his shoulder.
E  |||  
N  |||  He turns and sees Gaff leering at him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Not what Deckard expected or wanted. His eyes flicker
N  |||  a warning in Rachael's direction.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael is standing in the flow of pedestrians, Asians,
N  |||  Mexicans and Indians. She has already seen Gaff and
N  |||  she gets the message in Deckard's eyes and allows her-
N  |||  self to drift away, part of the stream of humanity
N  |||  moving down the sidewalk.
E  |||  
N  |||  But Gaff's sharp eyes have picked up Deckard's look
N  |||  and he glances.
E  |||  
N  |||  What Gaff sees is the back of a woman's head in the
N  |||  crowd.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff looks back at Deckard and makes a head movement
N  |||  indicating the vehicle at the curb.
E  |||  
N  |||  It's a spinner and Bryant is grinning at the window,
N  |||  chewing on a heater.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Christ, Deckard, ya look almost as
D  |||  bad as that tit job ya left under
D  |||  the bus. Almost.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard walks over to the spinner.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff is looking down the street, trying to make out the
N  |||  Caucasian woman disappearing in the crowd.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You get the call on the big one?
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Bet your ass. Two in one night,
D  |||  you're the same old shitstorm,
D  |||  aren't ya?
D  |||  (to Gaff)
D  |||  You could learn from this guy,
D  |||  Gaff. A goddamn one-man slaughter
D  |||  squad, that's what he is, a real
D  |||  shitstorm.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff has to smile and nod politely, that's his job.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard has followed Bryant's beady gaze to the obvious
N  |||  bottle he's holding in the paper bag.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I'm going home.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Home! A killer like you! I
D  |||  figured you'd be up all night
D  |||  slaughtering phonies. Four to
D  |||  go, thought you'd just leave
D  |||  'em dead in the alleys for us
D  |||  to pick up. Haw! Haw! Come on,
D  |||  Gaff.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Three. There's three to go.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Huh?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  There's three left.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Four. That tit job you vee kayed
D  |||  at the Tyrell Corp... disappeared.
D  |||  She didn't even know she was skin
D  |||  till you put the machine on her.
D  |||  Some kinda brain plant, says Tyrell.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard has already noticed that Gaff is looking down
N  |||  the street in the direction Rachael went.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff feels Deckard's eyes, turns and leers cheerfully
N  |||  at Deckard. Deckard meets the look... an ominous
N  |||  exchange.
E  |||

N  |||  dry blood and swollen, splits again and blood gushes
N  |||  into the clear liquid in the glass.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stares at the bloodstained drink ruefully, then
N  |||  takes a thirsty gulp and licks his bleeding lip.
E  |||  
N  |||  The ice in Rachael's glass is RATTLING. She's standing
N  |||  only a few feet away, half eaten by shadows, her eyes
N  |||  blank with shock.
E  |||  
N  |||  The reason the ice is rattling is because her hand is
N  |||  shaking.

N  |||  bathroom,framed by the open door. You get the
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard in the background, goes on drying. He's naked
N  |||  except for a towel around his waist.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael takes a drink. Her face is enigmatic. She's
N  |||  watching.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is unaware of her eyes on the back of his neck.

E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael appears in the doorway of the bathroom, drink
N  |||  in hand.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard doesn't acknowledge her presence.
E  |||  
N  |||  There is a long silence. She sees the muscle ripple in
N  |||  his naked back. Hard body. Scars of old wounds.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  What if I go North...
D  |||  disappeared ?

N  |||  Rachael waits a long tense moment for an answer.

N  |||  Deckard is sitting on the bed, wasted, still in his
N  |||  towel, clean white bandages on his face. He touches his
N  |||  lip gently.
E  |||  
N  |||  He can hear the clock ticking and then the whisper of her
N  |||  stockings as she approaches the bedroom from the hallway.
N  |||  He hears her stop, lost in the shadows beyond the door.
N  |||  A pause then her voice.

M  |||  RACHAEL (OS)
M  |||  The file on me.. the incept date,
M  |||  the longevity, the psycho-program,

N  |||  clock ticks for a long moment.
E  |||  
N  |||  In the corridor, lost in shadows, Rachael is working up
N  |||  the nerve to ask.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Yeah ?
E  |||  
N  |||  In the shadows Rachael takes a deep breath.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL

N  |||  Deckard, exhausted stares absently into space.

M  |||  DECKARD (O.S.)
M  |||  I didn't want to.
E  |||  
N  |||  It must come as a tremendous relief to her. She stands
N  |||  in the shadows, grateful for the smallest favours. She
N  |||  waits a moment, hearing the clock ticking, hearing the
N  |||  distant noises of an apartment house, then she speaks
N  |||  again.

E  |||  
N  |||  A picture of a little boy and his father in fishing
N  |||  clothes, each holding a pole, the boy proudly display-

D  |||  What's that's?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  My glands. They grow old too fast.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  Is that why you're still on earth?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Yeah. Couldn't pass the medical. Anyway
D  |||  I kinda like it here.
E  |||  
N  |||  A moment.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  And I like you just the way you are.
D  |||  Hi Roy.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian whips round. He is flanked a hair's breath away
N  |||  by Batty. The shock almost knocks him off his chair.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  This is my friend I was
D  |||  telling you about.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty smiles benevolently.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  Roy, this is my saviour, J.F. Sebastian.
E  |||  
N  |||  There is a long silence whilst everyone stares at each
N  |||  other.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian, still uneasy begins to smile.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  You certainly have a nice place.
E  |||  
N  |||  BATTY looks around admiringly. Sebastian mumbles some-
N  |||  thing that sounds like "Thank you".
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  Sebastian doesn't go out too much.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  I like a man who stays put. An admirable
D  |||  thing to be able to sustain yourself
D  |||  in these times. You live here all by
D  |||  yourself, do you ?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Yes....
D  |||  (after a moment)
D  |||  How about some breakfast, I was just
D  |||  going to make some.

M  |||  INT DECKARD'S BEDROOM - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard wakes up groggily. His face hurts. He touches
N  |||  the puffy purple bruises. He touches the lip and winces.
N  |||  He looks around stupid with sleep, orienting himself.
E  |||  
N  |||  He sits up... tries to remember. Was she here ? Were they
N  |||  talking ? He must have dozed off. He gets up laboriously,
N  |||  painfully and limps out of the bedroom still in yesterday's
N  |||  clothes.
E  |||  
M  |||  CUT TO

M  |||  INT. DECKARD'S LIVING ROOM MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael is sitting stone silent at the piano, staring at a
N  |||  picture of Deckard and his Father above the keyboard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Shadows brush across her, then Deckard is there, close to
N  |||  her, looking to see what's got her attention.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Me and my Dad.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Do you love him?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  He's dead.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael indicates the picture of Deckard's wife.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Wife.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Do you love her ?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  She left me.
D  |||  (pause)
D  |||  Went offworld.
D  |||  Wanted the good life.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  You didn't?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard changes the subject.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I dreamt music.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael answers his comment by touching the keys and
N  |||  filling the room abruptly with music.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I didn't know if I could play.
D  |||  ( pause)
D  |||  I remember lessons.... but I
D  |||  don't know if I took them... or
D  |||  Tyrell's niece.
E  |||  
N  |||  She stops doesn't finish the thought, goes on playing
N  |||  for a long moment.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  You play fine.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly she stops playing and turns to him. Al you
N  |||  can hear is the CLOCK TICKING.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Am I very different?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Yeah.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  How?
E  |||  
N  |||  Her voice is small. Something very young about her.
N  |||  She looks up at him for the first time.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Stand up.
E  |||  
N  |||  She does. She's looking up at him with those big mer-
N  |||  maid eyes and he kisses her mouth. And then again.
N  |||  She doesn't respond. His voice is a whisper.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Now you kiss me.
E  |||  
N  |||  She does -- but it's self conscious...
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I can't rely on my memory to...
E  |||  
N  |||  He stops her with another kiss.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Say what I say.
E  |||  
N  |||  She nods. His voice intimate, low.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Kiss me.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Kiss me.
E  |||  
N  |||  He does, soft, wet, tender. He backs off -- magnetic,
N  |||  palpable energy growing up between them.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  My eyes.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Kiss my eyes.
E  |||  
N  |||  She closes them. He kisses each fluttering lid.
E  |||  
N  |||  She's catching on quick. Her lips are right there.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I want you.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I want you.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Again.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  I want you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Her face is flushed. His fingers go to her mouth --
N  |||  slowly over her lips and inside, into the wetness. her
N  |||  head is leaning back, eyes shut.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Bite me.
E  |||  
N  |||  His mouth goes to her neck, her ear. His teeth evoke
N  |||  a shiver and a gasp as they take her flesh. Her breath
N  |||  is coming faster.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Put your hands on me.
E  |||  
N  |||  He rakes his fingers through her hair and pulls her
N  |||  into him. His other hand molding and pressing her,
N  |||  working around her body and under into the privacy
N  |||  of her dress.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Shall I take off my clothes?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Oh Yeah.
E  |||  
N  |||  He's kissing her hard, deep, soft. She's hardly able to
N  |||  talk she's so excited.
E  |||  
C  |||  RACHAEL
D  |||  Do whatever you want to me.
E  |||  
N  |||  He is and her legs can no longer hold her and she's
N  |||  sinking to the floor in his arms moaning, their words
N  |||  obscured by kisses.

M  |||  INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris is staring out the window, watching.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty lies quietly on the couch, rubbing one of his hands.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sounds emanate from the kitchen.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty gets up and goes to a chess set in the corner of the
N  |||  room, a game is obviously in progress. Batty studies it for
N  |||  a moment, then moves the White Queen to the Bishop.
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris walks over to him. Her tone muted but demanding.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  Well?
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even more
N  |||  pugnacious.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  I want to know what's going on ?
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  There's only two of us left.
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris is shocked. Her whisper comes out a hiss.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  Then we're stupid and we'll die.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Not if everybody is doing their job
D  |||  here at home. How are things at home ?
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris doesnt answer, as they hear Sebastian coming out of
N  |||  the kitchen.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  What if he won't co-operate ?
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to
D  |||  be appreciated. We'll appreciate him
D  |||  and he'll co-operate.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian walks into the room with a tray. He takes some
N  |||  eggs and puts them into a glass flask full of bubbling
N  |||  water that is standing on a retort stand over a bunsen
N  |||  burner on his work bench.
N  |||  He notices the move on the chess set.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  No. The Knight takes the Queen, see ?
D  |||  It won't do.
E  |||  
N  |||  He takes the White Queen with the Black Knight.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty smiles a smile totally without feeling or interest.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian stares at Batty for a long moment, then at Pris.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Why are you staring at us ?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  You're just so... so different.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty nods his head smiling, sending home the fact and
N  |||  Sebastian is certainly getting it.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  What Sebastian ?
E  |||  
N  |||  A long pause.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  What makes you think so, Sebastian?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Well, you're ....so perfect.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian is grinning from ear to ear.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  What generation are you ?
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Nexus 6.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian whistles.
E  |||  
N  |||  To the couch. Batty couldn't be more pleased.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  I know because I do genetic design work
D  |||  for the Tyrell Corporation.
D  |||  (proudly)
D  |||  There's some of me in you !
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  We have a lot in common.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  What do you mean ?
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  We have similar problems.
D  |||  Accelerated decrepitude.
D  |||  (or)
D  |||  Like the fabled salmon we came home to die.
D  |||  But we don't want to die quite yet.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Of course not...... Could you....
E  |||  
N  |||  His voice is trembling.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Show me something.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Like what ?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Like... anything?
E  |||  
N  |||  Like a million things, but he's too excited to think
N  |||  of one.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  We're not computers, Sebastian, we're
D  |||  physical.
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris perks up proudly.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  I think, therefore I am.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Very good Pris. Now show him why.
E  |||  
N  |||  Without a moment's hesitation, Pris walks over to the
N  |||  flask, sticks her hands into the boiling water and pulls
N  |||  out one of the eggs and hands it to Sebastian.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
N  |||  he's just seen the devil. He laughs nervously, glad that
N  |||  the devil is a friend. Then drops the egg which is
N  |||  suddenly burning his hand.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  You could help us.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  I don't know much about biomechanics
D  |||  Roy, I wish I did, but you're out of
D  |||  my league.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  If we don't find help soon, Pris
D  |||  hasn't got long to live.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty walks back to the chess set.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Is he good ?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Who?
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Your opponent.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  Dr. Tyrell.... More than brilliant.
D  |||  He's a genius. He's the Einstein
D  |||  of genetics.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Maybe he can help us, Sebastian.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  I'd be happy to mention it to him.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Be better if I could talk to him in
D  |||  person. But he's not an easy man to
D  |||  get to.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  No.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's eyes.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Will you help us ?
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  I....I.. can't.
E  |||  
N  |||  He gets up and walks slowly over to Pris.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  We really need you Sebastian, you're
D  |||  our best and only friend.
E  |||  
N  |||  A smile begins to spread across Sebastian's face. She
N  |||  is irresistable. He sits there for a long moment enjoying
N  |||  her embrace.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.
D  |||  What do you thin, Pris ?
E  |||  
C  |||  PRIS
D  |||  I don't think there's another human
D  |||  being in this whole world who would
D  |||  have helped us.
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris gives Sebastian a big kiss.

M  |||  INT. HOSPITAL (DAY)
E  |||  
N  |||  A horrid image! Tight on Holden very tight. His eyes
N  |||  are bulging almost out of his head. Tears streaming
N  |||  down his face, spittle spraying from his mouth as he
N  |||  wheezes and grimace in horrid convulsions. Haw haw haw.
N  |||  We're going to figure out that he's laughing, but only
N  |||  after a moment, after we pull back wide enough to see
N  |||  he's still engulfed in the breather and necklaced with
N  |||  blinking lights, one of which blinks particularly
N  |||  violently with every wheeze.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Cut it... ha, ah, ah.. cut it a haw,
D  |||  ah ah... cut it out.. Deckard.
D  |||  You're... ah... making me... peeeee.
D  |||  Looka the... ah, haw, light...
D  |||  you're making me piss, you... ass
D  |||  hole.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks uncomfortable and horrified.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Sorry.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Eeeeeeee... haw, ahw, ha. Hee...
D  |||  he... Hit you with a... ah. Ah.
D  |||  Snake... Oh Jesus! Aaaah. Stark
D  |||  ... Stark naked... Ah, ah oh ah...
D  |||  I love it.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  I thought you'd go for the part
D  |||  about the big guy... Leon.
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden's eyes change mood immediately at the thought
N  |||  of Leon but the laughter has to continue like a wind-
N  |||  up toy running down. Finally he can talk again.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  You aired him... what's funny
D  |||  about that?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Revenge. I thought you'd...
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden interrupts, no longer amused.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  You don't revenge a machine,
D  |||  asshole! Your slicer cuts your
D  |||  finger, whaddya do? Punish it?
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden looks at Deckard and lets his wisdom sink in.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  You can't make a 'thing' feel
D  |||  sorry, Deck.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  They're different, the new ones.
D  |||  That big one... he... it had
D  |||  feelings.
E  |||  
N  |||  Holden glares at Deckard for a long moment.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  Whatja do? Fuck it?
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Huh? Wh-what? Who who?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is alarmed. The secret is out.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  The tit job, the one with the
D  |||  snake. You stuck it in, didn't
D  |||  ya?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is immensely relieved and confused.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Uh... no... I mean... uh.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  You made zig zig, then you aired
D  |||  her out, now you got conscience,
D  |||  right?
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is smug, sure of himself. He knows the score.

E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  You got the feelings, pal, not her.
D  |||  You fucked a washing machine...
D  |||  then you switched it off. So what?
D  |||  You cry when you turn the lights
D  |||  out at night?
E  |||  
N  |||  Now we see Bryant. He's sitting in a chair chewing a
N  |||  big cigar and glaring at the screen.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  It's pitiful is what it is. A
D  |||  couple of old blade runners trying
D  |||  to grapple with metaphysics... You
D  |||  gonna turn out that way, Gaff?

C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  I piss on metaphysics. My middle

E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  You think he knows where she is?
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  Maybe. Maybe not. Deckard's a

D  |||  promotion, maybe I'll find her.
D  |||  If I get a promotion...
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  Shut up!
E  |||  
N  |||  Bryant is looking back at the screen, intensely inter-

N  |||  to Deckard.

D  |||  Work! Whaddaya mean 'work.'

D  |||  Don't you see what they're after,

E  |||  
N  |||  On the screen Deckard frowns and shakes his head.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  No. Who?
E  |||  
N  |||  Bryant is on the edge of his seat.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOLDEN
D  |||  God!
E  |||  
N  |||  Bryant stares at the screen dumbfounded. Then his jaw
N  |||  sags open in disbelief.
E  |||  
C  |||  BRYANT
D  |||  God!

N  |||  on the screen sequentially at the rate of fifty per

N  |||  doesn't look up at the sound of footsteps.
E  |||  
C  |||  SEBASTIAN
D  |||  I....uh.... I brought a friend.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell looks alarmed.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty is standing in the shadows.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell is reaching for a tasseled bell pull that hangs
N  |||  over his bed.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty's eyes are like little coals glowing.
E  |||  
N  |||  Warned by the look, Tyrell abandons the bell pull and
N  |||  reaches under the sheets for something.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  To act without understanding
D  |||  could lead to the very thing
D  |||  the act seeks to avoid.
E  |||  
N  |||  What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell decides to heed it. If he's scared though, he
N  |||  does a good job of concealing it.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  I'm surprised you didn't come
D  |||  here sooner.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty moves closer to the bed and the dogs slink away,
N  |||  scared toothless.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  It's not an easy thing to meet
D  |||  your Maker.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  And what can He do for you?
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty sits on the end of Tyrell's bed.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Can the Maker repair what He makes?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Would you like to be modified?
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Had mind something a little more
D  |||  radical.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  What's the problem?
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Death.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  I'm afraid that's a little out of
D  |||  my...
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty leans close across the sheets and cuts in in an
N  |||  urgent whisper.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  I want more life, fucker.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastain looks alarmed.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell faces Batty with admirable cool. After a tense
N  |||  pause, the old man slides away from Batty and out of
N  |||  bed. He's wearing a long night shirt and he looks a
N  |||  little silly. He looks down at Batty who's still sit-
N  |||  ting on the bed and addresses him as a professor add-
N  |||  resses a pupil.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  The facts of life. I'll be blunt.
D  |||  To make an alteration in the
D  |||  evolvement of an organic life
D  |||  system, at least by men, makers
D  |||  or not, is fatal. A coding
D  |||  sequence can't be revised once
D  |||  it's established.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Why?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Because by the second day of
D  |||  incubation any cells that have
D  |||  undergone reversion mutation
D  |||  give rise to revertant colonies --
D  |||  like rats leaving a sinking ship.
D  |||  The ship sinks.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  What about E.M.S. recombination?
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  We've already tried it -- ethyl
D  |||  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
D  |||  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
D  |||  created a virus so lethal the
D  |||  subject was destroyed before we
D  |||  left the table.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell doesn't notice the subtle flicker of suspicion
N  |||  on Batty's face... like maybe Batty's not buying all
N  |||  this.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Then a repressor protein that
D  |||  blocks the operating cells.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Wouldn't obstruct replication,
D  |||  but it does give rise to an error
D  |||  in replication so that the newly
D  |||  formed DNA strand carries a
D  |||  mutation and you've got a virus
D  |||  again... but all this is academic...
D  |||  you are made as well as we could
D  |||  make you.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  But not to last?
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty's expression doesn't reveal whether Tyrell has
N  |||  allayed his suspicions as Tyrell approaches Batty
N  |||  (sitting on the edge of the bed) and puts a fatherly
N  |||  hand on Batty's shoulder.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  The light that burns twice as
D  |||  bright burns half as long. And
D  |||  you have burned so very, very
D  |||  brightly, Roy.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty looks up at "Father" Tyrell, Tyrell is swelling
N  |||  with pride.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  The best of all possible replicants.
D  |||  We're proud of our prodigal son...
D  |||  glad you've returned. You're quite
D  |||  a prize.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty looks down in a sudden, uncharacteristically
N  |||  humble posture and speaks with guilt in his voice.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  I've done questionable things.
E  |||  
C  |||  TYRELL
D  |||  Also extraordinary things. --
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Nothing the God of bio-mechanics
D  |||  wouldn't let you in heaven for.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell in a burst of camaraderie, decides to give
N  |||  laughing a try and comes out with a little titter.
N  |||  After all, Roy Batty, that swell replicant is about
N  |||  to embrace him. Everything's gonna be okay after all.
N  |||  Batty gets up from the bed and puts his hands around
N  |||  Tyrell's face.
E  |||  
N  |||  CRACK! Tyrell's skull cracks like dry wood.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sebastian stares in horror.
E  |||  
N  |||  SQUISH! Batty squashes the head in a gruesome moment.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tyrell slumps to the floor like empty clothes.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty looks at the remains with disgust.
E  |||

D  |||  Revertant colonies! Methane sulfate!

E  |||  
N  |||  Very carefully he slides along the wall.
E  |||  
N  |||  We can see a doorway ahead of him, the door to Sebastian's

E  |||  
N  |||  Deep breath.

N  |||  bare thighs around his neck as she takes him down.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard finds himself choking ot death in bare thighs
N  |||  as she applies a brutal scissors grip with her legs.
N  |||  All he can do is bite at the flesh near her crotch as
N  |||  he fights for air and life.

N  |||  replicant and Deckard is
N  |||  falls from his hand as he writhes and

E  |||  
N  |||  Finally he gets his head loose and gasps for air but
N  |||  she is immediately sitting on his chest and he looks up
N  |||  into her furious face and flailing fists.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard grabs at her trying to fight her off, tears
N  |||  her tank top loose, exposing one breast, but a lot of
N  |||  good that does him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Pris starts to choke Deckard with one hand and Deckard's
N  |||  only hope is to grasp blindly for his blaster on the floor.
E  |||  
N  |||  His hand paws wildly... he can't look... in the general
N  |||  area, and when he feels it he grabs it. He struggles
N  |||  to point it at her.

E  |||  
N  |||  Fat chance! It doesn't look like he could if he wanted
N  |||  to. She's choking him with one hand, squeezing the
N  |||  weapon loose with the other.

N  |||  wrench and manages to bring the weapon to bear just
N  |||  long enough to squeeze off one shot.

N  |||  badly battered by her furious feet.
E  |||  
N  |||  BOW! BOW! Pris is blown away
N  |||  hits.
E  |||  
N  |||  BOW! The third hit catches her in the back of the neck
N  |||  as she spins away from Deckard... and that's it, she
N  |||  goes down in a limp heap, leaving Deckard standing there,
N  |||  bloody and stupified.
E  |||  
N  |||  He's still staring when he hears it... the drone of the
N  |||  elevator ascending.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard frowns. He starts toward the door, reaching in his
N  |||  pocket as he goes and pulling out a cassette.

E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard slams the cassette into his blaster as he steps
N  |||  intop the corridor and looks toward the sound.
E  |||  
N  |||  He sees the elevator coming up.... glowing.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard doesn't like this. He glances quickly as the
N  |||  various possible routes for escpe.
E  |||  
N  |||  Not the stairs.
E  |||  
N  |||  Nothing else.
E  |||  
N  |||  The lift is almost to Sebastian's floor.

E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard considers.
E  |||  
N  |||  The footsteps are getting closer.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard walks silently toward the other door leading into the
N  |||  next room and steps through it.

N  |||  Batty's shadow appears in the doorway (Deckard's POV) he
N  |||  stares at Pris' dead body.
E  |||  
N  |||  His body walks into the shadow.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard fires, but Batty is faster, he ducks back and
N  |||  disappears.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's bullet smashes into the dresser in the bedroom,
N  |||  the mirror explodes.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard runs into the billiard room.

E  |||  
N  |||  He ducks back behind the wall.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly a hand comes tearing through the wall, and pulls
N  |||  Deckard's hand through.
E  |||  
N  |||  Systematically, Batty breaks two of Deckard's fingers.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  For Pris... for Zhora....
D  |||  Proud of yourself little man....
E  |||  
N  |||  As Deckard screams, Batty puts the gun back in Deckard's
N  |||  broken hand and pushes it back through the hole.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty's head peers through the hole, and Deckards fires at
N  |||  him grazing the side of his face and blowing off his ear.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard starts running (hand held) through the rooms
N  |||  looking for an escape.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY(OS)

N  |||  Then he starts to strip down - a tribal ritual.

N  |||  INT. DARKENED ROOM (re-dressed lobby) ARMOIRE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard runs into the darkened room. Rats scuttle across
N  |||  the floor.
E  |||  
N  |||  He hears footsteps coming. There are no other exits.
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks at the armoire. His only escape.
E  |||  
N  |||  He runs to a table and with great pain bends his fingers back
N  |||  then runs to the armoire and starts to climb it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty walks into the room looks up at Deckard and starts
N  |||  to laugh.
E  |||  
C  |||  BATTY
D  |||  Where are you going ?

E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's head pops up through the floor next to an
N  |||  overflowing toilet.
E  |||  
N  |||  All of a sudden he too starts to laugh, as he lays down
N  |||  on the floor, his laughter becoming hysterical.
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks around for some tape and starts to wrap his broken
N  |||  fingers.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly, with a resounding crash Batty's head comes through
N  |||  the marble above the basin.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard gets up and makes a run for the door at the end of
N  |||  the room, as Batty, animal like, starts slurping the water
N  |||  out of the basin.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard pulls and tugs at the door, frantic with fear.
E  |||  
N  |||  The other door opens and Batty walks in, as Deckard manages
N  |||  to open his door.

M  |||  INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Two hundred objects (pigeons) burst out of the room into

N  |||  Deckard slowly eases himself around the window ledge
N  |||  and edges his way around to a cornice.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty appears at another window, as Deckard scrambles
N  |||  up the cornice and on to the roof, wind and rain hindering
N  |||  his climb.

M  |||  EXT ROOF - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Wind and rain. Deckard dashes onto the roof and looks
N  |||  frantically over his shoulder. Batty isn't in sight yet.
N  |||  He looks around desperately. The roof is a desert no
N  |||  shelter. Deckard looks across at the next building.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly a rooftop door opens and Batty steps out.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks back at the next building. Is it possible ?
N  |||  A long jump. But what choice.
E  |||  
N  |||  Decision time. Deckard decides to go. He runs directly
N  |||  towards Batty, turns, pumping like crazy, going for the gap.

N  |||  ground.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks behind him, over his shoulder.
E  |||  
N  |||  He can see Batty twenty feet away on the edge of the

N  |||  fingers open with effort.

N  |||  Batty looks down at Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty grins and takes a seat only a couple of feet
N  |||  from Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's bad hand lets go. He's hanging by one hand.
E  |||  
N  |||  The street looms way below.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks desperately into Batty's cold eyes.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty grins and shakes his head at the absurdity of it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks into that awful smile and sees no hope
N  |||  there.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty glances down at his own hand. Spasms again.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's hand is going. He knows it's over now, he
N  |||  bites the bullet of his anger. He glares at Batty as
N  |||  his grip gives way.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Asshole!
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty meets Deckard's angry eyes.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's hand continues to slip.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty is still looking at Deckard's rage. It moves the
N  |||  warrior in him, you can see Batty change his opinion.
E  |||  
N  |||  Too late! Deckard's hand goes.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty's hand is like lightning. He catches Deckard's
N  |||  hand and holds Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is suspended above the awesome drop, not sure
N  |||  why he's not falling. He opens his tightly closed eyes
N  |||  and looks up.
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks up into the stern warrior face of Batty, the
N  |||  cold eyes!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard hangs there and for a moment he has to consider
N  |||  whether this is the continuation of a cruel game.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Batty is hauling him up one-handed and with that
N  |||  scary strength he has.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is pulled onto the roof where he lies on his
N  |||  stomach gasping for breath, not moving, just feeling
N  |||  something solid under him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty looks at the man gasping next to him with the
N  |||  cold eyes of a man looking at a fish. It is as though
N  |||  Deckard is some species far below Batty on the evolu-
N  |||  tionary scale.
E  |||  
N  |||  Batty's hand cramps again.

N  |||  Batty is partly crumpled, frozen in an unnatural posi-
N  |||  tion as though he had been writhing and stopped mid-
N  |||  writhe. He looks back at Deckard with eyes full of
N  |||  life and intensity.
E  |||  
N  |||  They stare at each other for a long time in silence,
N  |||  communicating something with their eyes... without
N  |||  expression. Finally Batty breaks the silence.

D  |||  seen things you little people
D  |||  wouldn't believe... Attack ships
D  |||  on fire off the shoulder of Orion
D  |||  bright as magnesium... I rode on
D  |||  the back decks of a blinker and

D  |||  near the Tanhauser Gate.

N  |||  almost lifelessly. A pigeon flutters down and perches
N  |||  on his shoulder. Batty doesn't stir.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is watching motionless.

E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD (V.O.)
D  |||  I watched him die all night. It
D  |||  was a long, slow thing and he
D  |||  fought it all the way. He never
D  |||  whimpered and he never quit. He
D  |||  took all the time he had... as
D  |||  though he loved life very much...
D  |||  every second of it... even the
D  |||  pain. Then he was dead.

N  |||  Deckard's at the edge of the roof.
E  |||  
N  |||  Maybe someday he'll be better. But right now he hasn't
N  |||  even got the energy to be sick.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Mexican's voice doesn't surprise him, it comes through
N  |||  the silence like the rasping of raven's wings.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  How do you rate yourself, now Deckard ?
E  |||  
N  |||  He is standing 20 feet away, on the edge of the roof, like

N  |||  a foot on the buttress....
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  You put on quite a show - no doubt
D  |||  about it...
E  |||  
N  |||  With a flourish he brings a dirty rag out of his pocket and
N  |||  starts polishing the pointed tip of his long black shoe.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  You think I'm a wimp - don't you.
E  |||  
N  |||  He waits for the answer. But Deckard doesn't bother.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff moistens the rag with his tongue and applies it to
N  |||  the toe.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  I could kill you right now -
D  |||  so you better say something.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is unarmed. Gaff's got all the aces- seems to be
N  |||  bristling with concealed weapons. Deckard's eyes level on
N  |||  him. His voice comes out low and raw.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Yeah. I think you're a wimp.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff nods like he knew it all along - it seems to please
N  |||  him.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  I admire you more and more.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard exhales fatigue. His eyes close. The bullshit
N  |||  is endless. Gaff smiles like a beaver. Puts the rag back
N  |||  in his pocket.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  I guess you're through, huh.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard doesn't answer.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  Washed up. Wiped out. Finished.
E  |||  
N  |||  He cocks his head like a bluejay waiting for the answer.
E  |||

D  |||  What about it.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD
D  |||  Yeah. I'm through.
E  |||  
N  |||  Somewhere far away a whistle blows. Then silence. Deckard
N  |||  turns. He is moving away. His back to the Mexican. Gaff's
N  |||  voice follows him. Taunting.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  You did
D  |||  sure you are, man.
E  |||  
N  |||  He snickers. His hand comes out of his pocket with a gun.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  It's hard to be sure who's who around
D  |||  here.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard keeps walking.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  Carnall!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard slowly turns.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff shows him the gun. But it doesn't make any difference.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  Oye la agua.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard stares. He doesn't know the words.

N  |||  Ever the dandy, Gaff swaggers closer, stops.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  Here.
E  |||  
N  |||  He throws the gun across the gap to Deckard.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard doesn't try to catch it. It lands at his feet.
E  |||  
N  |||  Gaff dismisses the rejection with a suck on his teeth.
E  |||  
C  |||  GAFF
D  |||  I wouldn't wait too long. I wouldn't
D  |||  fool around. I'd get my little panocha
D  |||  and get the hell outta here.
E  |||  
N  |||  They just stare at each other. Gaff smiles.
E  |||

D  |||  It's too bad, she don't last, eh!

N  |||  breathing.
E  |||  
N  |||  A long moment.
E  |||  
N  |||  Then the tension goes out of him. She's alive. He
N  |||  turns away from her with a new urgency.

D  |||  I trust you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard turns and looks at her, one hand full of
N  |||  clothes, the other hand holding the parachute bag.

M  |||  INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The door opens and Deckard and Rachael step out. They
N  |||  are carrying a couple of overnight cases.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael starts toward the elevator.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard locks the door and turns to follow her.
E  |||  
N  |||  He spots something on the floor, something small.
E  |||  
N  |||  He reaches down and picks it up.
E  |||  
N  |||  It's the tiny unicorn made of tinfoil... Gaff's
N  |||  gauntlet.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard looks at it for a moment.

M  |||  EXT. MOVING TREES - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Birch trees whip past at 160 miles per hour urged on
N  |||  by big, nasty MUSIC.
E  |||  
N  |||  We have the feeling we are going to see a unicorn.
E  |||  
N  |||  Instead we see Deckard's car rocketing through the
N  |||  woods.

M  |||  INT. DECKARD'S CAR - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard is at the wheel, Rachael is beside him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard smiles at her.
E  |||  
N  |||  Rachael smiles back tentatively.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard glances back at the road, then at the vid
N  |||  screen.
E  |||  
N  |||  A little blip flashes on the screen.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard notices it, his eyes narrow just a little. He
N  |||  reaches in his pocket, pulls out the unicorn.
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard puts the tinfoil unicorn on the dash.
E  |||  
N  |||  A flicker of a smile crosses his face.

M  |||  EXT. WOODS - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's car bullets through the woods in a fury of
N  |||  speed and MUSIC.
E  |||  
N  |||  We BACK OFF IT AND UP, PAST whizzing branches, OVER
N  |||  the treetops, losing the car as we SOAR over what is
N  |||  suddenly a vast forest spreading to infinity.
E  |||  
N  |||  Enormous MUSIC!
E  |||  
N  |||  Deckard's voice over.
E  |||  
C  |||  DECKARD (V.O.)
D  |||  I knew it on the roof that night.
D  |||  We were brothers, Roy Batty and I!
D  |||  Combat models of the highest order.
D  |||  We had fought in wars not yet
D  |||  dreamed of... in vast nightmares
D  |||  still unnamed. We were the new
D  |||  people... Roy and me and Rachael!
D  |||  We were made for this world. It
D  |||  was ours!
E  |||  
N  |||  Trees explode PAST US in a rage of branches as we DIP
N  |||  and SWERVE and that's when the spinner looms INTO VIEW
N  |||  zooming RIGHT AT US, then tilting and yawing off in
N  |||  hot pursuit with Gaff at the controls.
E  |||  
N  |||  CREDITS ARE ROLLING, God help us all!
E  |||  
M  |||  FADE OUT.
E  |||  
E  |||  
M  |||  THE END
