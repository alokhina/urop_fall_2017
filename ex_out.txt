E  |||  
M  |||  FADE IN:
E  |||  
C  |||  ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
E  |||  
N  |||  The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
N  |||  of looking through a kaleidoscope.
E  |||  
N  |||  As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
N  |||  inside a CANDY BOWL. A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
N  |||  removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The man performing this curious task is
N  |||  writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
N  |||  conservatively dressed in suit and tie. He sits alone at an
N  |||  empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
N  |||  some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
N  |||  the table's paper cloth.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor finishes sorting. Finding no trash can to deposit the
N  |||  rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
E  |||  
N  |||  A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches. He looks
N  |||  ill.
E  |||  
C  |||  P.A.
D  |||  Mr. Taransky --
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She's walking?... Don't tell me
D  |||  she's walking.
D  |||  (blood slowly draining
D  |||  from his face)
D  |||  She is not walking... She can't
D  |||  walk.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. TRAILER - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
N  |||  face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
N  |||  from a movie trailer to a limousine. VIKTOR desperately
N  |||  follows after Nicola.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- Nicola! How was your massage?
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  You're in breach.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- Is this about the new pages? --
D  |||  I made the changes you wanted,
D  |||  you're in virtually every scene --
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (wheeling on him)
D  |||  It's not the size of the role,
D  |||  Viktor.
D  |||  (suddenly very cool)
D  |||  Am I or am I not contractually
D  |||  entitled to the biggest trailer on
D  |||  the set?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (regarding the enormous
D  |||  silver fish behind them,
D  |||  confused)
D  |||  It's the biggest on earth! I
D  |||  swear! It's a 50-foot Airstream --
D  |||  they don't make them any longer
D  |||  than that.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  Taller, Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Taller? What?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor looks up in horror. The trailer next to Nicola's does
N  |||  indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (walking away)
D  |||  You've insulted me for the last
D  |||  time.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor looks to the tires. His face suddenly brightens.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Nicola, it's just the tires --
D  |||  they're over-inflated! I can fix
D  |||  it!
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
N  |||  stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen. Air hisses out.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  See, it's lower already.
E  |||  
N  |||  Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
N  |||  PUBLICIST. Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I beg you. You can't do this to
D  |||  me.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (looking back)
D  |||  I had three other offers. I only
D  |||  signed on to this picture out of...
D  |||  loyalty.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Then show some. They'll shut me
D  |||  down!
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (opening the car door)
D  |||  It wasn't working anyhow. The
D  |||  scene with the thousand geese -- I
D  |||  don't understand this film. I
D  |||  don't think anyone will understand
D  |||  it. I already put out a press
D  |||  release -- citing "creative
D  |||  differences".
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You know what, Nicola, you're
D  |||  right.
D  |||  (picking up her last piece
D  |||  of luggage)
D  |||  Here, let me help you with that.
D  |||  (holding the door for her)
D  |||  You ought to go. The truth is I
D  |||  don't deserve you. This film
D  |||  doesn't deserve you. Frankly, it
D  |||  deserves much, much better. The
D  |||  reason it's not working is because
D  |||  you're not about the work.
E  |||  
N  |||  Nicola is stunned.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to the limo driver)
D  |||  To Hell, please.
E  |||  
N  |||  The door slams and the limo roars away. Viktor looks to the
N  |||  still hissing trailer tire. The CREW regards Viktor
N  |||  apprehensively.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to the crew)
D  |||  What are you looking at? Get back
D  |||  to work.
E  |||  
N  |||  The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a
N  |||  veil of netting. A distraught man, HAL, sits close by.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (whispered)
D  |||  Jack... are you there?
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  I'm here. I'm right beside you.
E  |||  
N  |||  A NUN enters.
E  |||  
C  |||  NUN
D  |||  (to Hal)
D  |||  You should really go now.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  No, it's alright. Please, let him
D  |||  stay.
E  |||  
N  |||  The nun withdraws. Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
N  |||  breaking down.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (a glance to heaven)
D  |||  What kind of cruel God is it that
D  |||  would take you away from me?
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  The same one who brought me to you.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  No... I cannot accept it. If
D  |||  something like this can happen.
D  |||  What...
D  |||  (struggling to find the
D  |||  words)
D  |||  What is it for?
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (smiles through her pain)
D  |||  -- Why are we here? Is that what
D  |||  you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
D  |||  here? No why. Just here.
E  |||  
N  |||  Nicola dies peacefully.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio
N  |||  head ELAINE CHRISTIAN, watching a rough assembly of the film.
N  |||  It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
E  |||  
N  |||  The lights go up. The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 1
D  |||  She's good. You can hardly tell
D  |||  she's reading off a teleprompter.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (ignoring him)
D  |||  I've analyzed the footage. We've
D  |||  got almost everything we need in
D  |||  the can. If we rework the script,
D  |||  we can finish the film without her.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 2
D  |||  (forceful shake of the
D  |||  head)
D  |||  According to the writ her attorneys
D  |||  filed at noon today. They'll sue
D  |||  if the film is released with Nicola
D  |||  in a single frame.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (more anxious)
D  |||  So we'll re-cast.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Nicola Anders is the only actress
D  |||  who can play that role.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (incredulous)
D  |||  It's a re-make, Hal. Anders is not
D  |||  bigger than this picture.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine finally speaks up.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Of course she is. No other name is
D  |||  going to sign on now and risk
D  |||  offending her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  We don't need a name. We'll cast
D  |||  an unknown.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  I won't play opposite an unknown.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  We can't sell an unknown. Nicola's
D  |||  soured on the project and we have
D  |||  to accept that. If we ever want to
D  |||  be in the Nicola Anders business
D  |||  again, we have to cut our losses
D  |||  and shelve the picture.
E  |||  
N  |||  The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (aghast)
D  |||  No! You will not give in to that
D  |||  blackmailing bitch!
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (a wince, addressing
D  |||  everyone but Viktor)
D  |||  Excuse us.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
N  |||  soundstage. They speak more freely in each other's company.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  God, Viktor. Why do you always
D  |||  have to make things so difficult
D  |||  for yourself?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Difficult. I'm difficult.
E  |||  
N  |||  He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (referring to the candy)
D  |||  -- Do you know what these are,
D  |||  Elaine?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (talking a piece of candy
D  |||  and eating it)
D  |||  Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
D  |||  Mike & Ike's. Do you know why I,
D  |||  Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
D  |||  Award nominated director --
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- overseeing the most cherished
D  |||  movie project of my career, am
D  |||  walking around with a pocketful of
D  |||  cherry Mike & Ike's?
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- I have a feeling you're going to
D  |||  tell me.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- I'll tell you why. It is
D  |||  because Miss Nicola Anders,
D  |||  supermodel with a SAG card God's
D  |||  gift to cinema, has it written into
D  |||  her contract that all cherry Mike &
D  |||  Ike's be removed from her candy
D  |||  dish along with strict instructions
D  |||  that any room she walks into should
D  |||  have seven packs of cigarettes
D  |||  waiting for her three of them
D  |||  opened, that there be a personal
D  |||  jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
D  |||  dressing room, and that any time
D  |||  she travels, her nanny must fly
D  |||  with her first class.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- What's wrong with that?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Elaine, she doesn't have any
D  |||  children!
D  |||  (grabbing her arm)
D  |||  Don't you see? We're being held
D  |||  hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
D  |||  someone somewhere has decreed are
D  |||  the A-list.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  The public decides who's on that
D  |||  list.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Please.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  It's the truth. Those 17
D  |||  superstars are our insurance
D  |||  policy. We can't open -- can't
D  |||  make a profit without them.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  We can hardly make a profit with
D  |||  them. Up-front salary, back-end
D  |||  deal, perks, per diem, percentages
D  |||  -- They're mocking us, Elaine.
D  |||  We're at their mercy.
D  |||  (staring wistful, into
D  |||  space)
D  |||  We always had movie stars but they
D  |||  used to be our stars. We used to
D  |||  decide who would play what role.
D  |||  We told them what to wear, what to
D  |||  say, who to date. When they were
D  |||  under contract, we could change
D  |||  their names if we wanted to -- more
D  |||  than once!
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (regarding him as if he's
D  |||  insane)
D  |||  You realize you're nostalgic for an
D  |||  era you weren't even born in?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (irritated at her
D  |||  infuriating logic)
D  |||  Well, I do remember why I started
D  |||  out in this business -- you seem to
D  |||  have forgotten -- working in New
D  |||  York with Cassevetes -- we were
D  |||  trying to do something important,
D  |||  shine a light in that darkened
D  |||  cinema --
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (rolling her eyes)
D  |||  -- It's called a projector.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (ignoring her)
D  |||  -- Illuminate hearts and minds with
D  |||  a ray of truth.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Listen, Viktor, I have good
D  |||  memories of those days too -- but
D  |||  this isn't about that or you or me
D  |||  or some high-minded ideal. This is
D  |||  business.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Spare me.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (gesturing at the studio
D  |||  lot)
D  |||  -- Christ, Viktor, look around.
D  |||  What do you think pays for all
D  |||  this? This is about investment and
D  |||  return. Those days in New York...
D  |||  that's... it's over.
E  |||  
N  |||  A pause. Viktor reads Elaine's face.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You're not renewing my contract.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  How can I? Your last three
D  |||  pictures tanked. The board is
D  |||  giving me hell. No bankable star
D  |||  will work with you after this. If
D  |||  you just compromised... a little.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
N  |||  news.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (rueful smile)
D  |||  -- Well, it's not every day you're
D  |||  fired by the mother of your own
D  |||  child.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
N  |||  moment between them.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (softening, a heart-to
D  |||  heart)
D  |||  I'm not taking away your daughter,
D  |||  just your deal. You and I both
D  |||  know, after the divorce I kept you
D  |||  on for old time's sake, so you
D  |||  could still hold your head up in
D  |||  front of Lainey. I called what's
D  |||  his name at Warner's. He said he'd
D  |||  take a meeting -- in July. I've
D  |||  fought for you Viktor...
D  |||  (voice trails off)
D  |||  You want to talk severance?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (staring off into the
D  |||  distance, face hardening)
D  |||  You can have everything -- office,
D  |||  car, assistants -- all I want is
D  |||  the picture.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  The picture's dead.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  So there's no problem -- I can have
D  |||  the rights, the negative too?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (believing she's getting
D  |||  off lightly)
D  |||  They're yours. But how are you
D  |||  going to finish it? Without a star
D  |||  there's no movie.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I don't need a star. All I need is
D  |||  an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
D  |||  cut out Nicola and replace her with
D  |||  a real actor. A real leading lady.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Even if you find her, you know the
D  |||  problem with unknowns, Viktor. If
D  |||  they're good, they get known. And
D  |||  then you're back to sorting their
D  |||  candy... and worse.
D  |||  (kissing him on the cheek
D  |||  as she departs in her
D  |||  studio golf cart)
D  |||  I'm sorry, Viktor.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
N  |||  alone on the deserted lot.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame. VIKTOR's face
N  |||  appears amongst them.
E  |||  
N  |||  They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
N  |||  of an electric cart. A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
N  |||  standees from around the lot.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
N  |||  we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
N  |||  year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop
N  |||  computer.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Hi, Dad.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (slightly ashamed)
D  |||  Hello, sweetheart.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the
N  |||  suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey smiles sweetly. She hugs him.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I'm sorry Mom canned you.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (shrugging)
D  |||  It's really... not anything,
D  |||  Lainey. It's just --
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Don't feel too bad.
D  |||  (glancing to a standee)
D  |||  Mom runs the place and they still
D  |||  walk all over her. You're better
D  |||  off out of it.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (regarding his daughter)
D  |||  You look very grown up. What are
D  |||  you doing? You meeting your mom
D  |||  for dinner?
E  |||  
N  |||  She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
N  |||  ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
N  |||  boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (reluctant admission)
D  |||  Kent got tickets to the ballet.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (trying to convince
D  |||  himself as much as
D  |||  Lainey)
D  |||  I'm going to finish the picture,
D  |||  sweetheart. It's important.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (not quite convinced)
D  |||  I know you'll do it, Dad. You're
D  |||  Viktor Taransky.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye. She runs to her
N  |||  mother and Kent.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to himself)
D  |||  That's right. I'm Viktor Taransky.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of
C  |||  VIKTOR.
E  |||  
C  |||  KENT
D  |||  You had no choice, Elaine. He's a
D  |||  liability.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (wistful look to Viktor)
D  |||  He also happens to be the most
D  |||  talented man I've ever known.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO BACKLOT - TRAM - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  CLOSE UP on a copy of "Variety". The front page banner
N  |||  headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative
N  |||  Differences"
E  |||  
N  |||  The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on
N  |||  a studio tour -- HANK ALENO. He wears a pair of spectacles
N  |||  with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side. It
N  |||  is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one
N  |||  good eye.
E  |||  
M  |||  TARANSKY CALLS A-LIST:
D  |||  "OVER-PRICED, OVER-PAMPERED PRIMA DONNAS"
D  |||  - Director's Future Now In Doubt -
E  |||  
N  |||  The tram pauses. The TOUR GUIDE keeps up a commentary.
E  |||  
C  |||  TOUR GUIDE
D  |||  -- On your left, the house where
D  |||  Claris Commodore uttered those now
D  |||  immortal words, "If that door
D  |||  doesn't hold, stand behind me".
D  |||  And coming up on your right --
E  |||  
N  |||  When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the
N  |||  tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway
N  |||  entrance. The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay
N  |||  With The Tour".
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO GATE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding
N  |||  several framed black and white photographs of screen legends
N  |||  under his arm.
E  |||  
N  |||  HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.
N  |||  He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated
N  |||  Bentley.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  -- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky...
D  |||  thank God. I've been trying to see
D  |||  you, calling -- Your assistant
D  |||  wouldn't put me through. I told
D  |||  her it was a matter of life and
D  |||  death. I was afraid I wouldn't get
D  |||  to you in time --
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (using his stack of film
D  |||  cans as a barrier)
D  |||  -- Please, get away from me.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  I did it, Mr. Taransky. I licked
D  |||  skin. I licked hair. I licked
D  |||  every part of her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (more disturbed, fearing
D  |||  he is dealing with a
D  |||  pervert)
D  |||  You want me to call Security?
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  I have her, Mr. Taransky. The
D  |||  answer to your prayers.
D  |||  (producing the "Variety"
D  |||  article, conspiratorial)
D  |||  The answer to this.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (regarding the article)
D  |||  I was misquoted.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  I have your new leading lady...
D  |||  (indicating the bulge in
D  |||  his pocket)
D  |||  ... right here in my pants.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the
N  |||  man's motives.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  (trying to reassure)
D  |||  It's me, Mr. Taransky. Don't you
D  |||  recognize me? -- The Future of
D  |||  Film conference in San Jose.
D  |||  Hank... Hank Aleno. I was keynote
D  |||  speaker. You must remember my
D  |||  speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (faint glimmer of
D  |||  recognition)
D  |||  That's right. You were booed off
D  |||  the stage. That's got to be -- ?
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  -- Eight years ago. In that whole
D  |||  time, I never left my computer.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (wary)
D  |||  Good for you, Hank.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  (referring to his covered
D  |||  eye)
D  |||  Good and bad. They think that's
D  |||  what caused this. Me eye tumor.
D  |||  Microwaves from the screen. It's
D  |||  the size of a grapefruit. Heavy
D  |||  too.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (regarding the pathetic
D  |||  figure with the tilted
D  |||  head)
D  |||  I'm sorry.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  Don't be. It was worth it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket. Viktor
N  |||  now understands the significance of the gesture.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  You have to see her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (loading cans into the
D  |||  car)
D  |||  I've seen them all before.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  Not like this --
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (patronizing smile)
D  |||  Come on, Hank. A synthespian,
D  |||  virtual actor -- ?
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  (irritated)
D  |||  -- We call them "vactors".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I need flesh and --
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  -- Flesh is weak.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- a living, breathing actor -- I
D  |||  can't work with a fake.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor loads his film cans into the car.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  (pointing to Nicola in
D  |||  Variety)
D  |||  You already do. But my actor won't
D  |||  get old, fat, lazy or drunk --
D  |||  won't throw tantrums, demand a body
D  |||  double, script changes or a bigger
D  |||  trailer.
D  |||  (whispers, conspiratorial)
D  |||  The Disney Corporation has been
D  |||  using artificial actors for years.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  That's the point, Hank. No matter
D  |||  how good they are, they're still
D  |||  Mickey Mouse. Everyone's tried.
D  |||  Everyone's failed. It can't be
D  |||  done.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  It can -- with my new computer
D  |||  code, you and me, we can do it
D  |||  together.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I don't know anything about
D  |||  computers.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  That's why you're so perfect. You
D  |||  have something I don't have.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  What's that?
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  An eye -- for performance. You
D  |||  know the truth when you see it. I
D  |||  know. I've seen your movies. I
D  |||  love your movies.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You do?
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  "Straw God" changed my life.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You saw that?
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  I've seen every frame of your work.
D  |||  You're the only filmmaker in
D  |||  Hollywood with the artistic
D  |||  integrity to realize my vision.
D  |||  You and me, art and science... we
D  |||  are the perfect marriage.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Listen, Hank, it's been a rough
D  |||  day.
D  |||  (climbing into his car)
D  |||  I'll call you about his next week.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  (at the car window)
D  |||  I won't be here next week. The
D  |||  tumor's inoperable. I'll be dead.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (winding down the window)
D  |||  I'm already dead.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's car roars away. He looks back at the forlorn Hank
N  |||  in the rear view mirror.
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK
D  |||  Call me.
D  |||  (looking at his watch)
D  |||  This week!
E  |||  
N  |||  A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
N  |||  wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A sea of ingenue headshots. Black X's are drawn through all
N  |||  of them. VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
N  |||  the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (into phone, referring to
D  |||  a young woman's headshot)
D  |||  -- What do you mean she won't work
D  |||  with me? She's done nothing. She
D  |||  doesn't have a single credit --
E  |||  
C  |||  AGENT'S VOICE
D  |||  (from phone, off-camera)
D  |||  -- Better no credits than a
D  |||  Taransky credit. No young actress
D  |||  is going to step into Nicola
D  |||  Anders' shoes and risk ending her
D  |||  career before it's even started.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- Art, you don't understand. I've
D  |||  mortgaged everything to finish this
D  |||  film -- creditors calling, coming
D  |||  to the house, for God's sake, I
D  |||  need this --
E  |||  
N  |||  The phone goes dead. Viktor tries to re-dial --
N  |||  disconnected.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- Damn.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sharp knock on his door. Viktor peers through a curtain and
N  |||  spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
N  |||  to be a legal notice in his hands.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor slips out of the back door.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. BEACH - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR hurries along the beach. When he turns, he discovers
N  |||  the MAN IN THE SUIT following him. As Viktor runs, the Suit
N  |||  runs -- calling out to him.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAN IN THE SUIT
D  |||  Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (calling back)
D  |||  I'm not him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor stumbles. When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAN IN THE SUIT
D  |||  Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
D  |||  estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
D  |||  (showing him Hank's
D  |||  obituary in the L.A.
D  |||  Times)
D  |||  It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
D  |||  you have this.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  What is it?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAN IN THE SUIT
D  |||  I have no idea, Sir. He wanted you
D  |||  to have it.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Suit departs. Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
N  |||  the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive. The hard-drive
N  |||  is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
E  |||  
M  |||  A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
E  |||  
C  |||  SIX MONTHS LATER
E  |||  
C  |||  CLOSE UP ON
E  |||  
N  |||  a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
E  |||  
N  |||  On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR. The red
N  |||  carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
N  |||  venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET". To save money
N  |||  on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
N  |||  NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere. No paparazzi, no
N  |||  limos, no klieg lights. Resorting to giving away tickets to
N  |||  PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
N  |||  trash.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Want to see a free movie?
E  |||  
C  |||  HOMELESS MAN
D  |||  (he thinks)
D  |||  No.
E  |||  
N  |||  A taxi pulls up. Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (kissing him hello)
D  |||  Hi, Dad.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Hello, Lainey.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
N  |||  cash. Lainey pays herself.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Your mother couldn't make it?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  She's at the premiere of "A Cold
D  |||  Day In Hell". But I think she send
D  |||  someone from Acquisitions.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She still with Kent?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  This week anyhow.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
N  |||  the pathetic premiere. As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
N  |||  sole spotlight expires.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Not quite how I imagined it --
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (looking on the bright
D  |||  side)
D  |||  -- You finished the film on your
D  |||  own terms, that's what matters.
D  |||  Did you really do all the post
D  |||  yourself?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  There was no other way.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I missed you. I wondered if you
D  |||  were ever coming back.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Me too.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (regarding the makeshift
D  |||  poster, trying to lift
D  |||  his spirits)
D  |||  Well, I can't wait to meet
D  |||  Simone... what's her last name?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You know, I... don't know.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Is she here tonight?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She can't watch herself.
E  |||  
N  |||  They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
E  |||  
C  |||  THEATER OWNER
D  |||  -- Hey, we have to start. I've got
D  |||  "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  A foggy, empty pier. A MAN is running through the mist,
N  |||  shouting desperately.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Valarie! VALARIE!
E  |||  
N  |||  Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
N  |||  hood, her back to us. The camera pushes in, music swells and
N  |||  she turns. SIMONE. She is exquisitely, ethereally
N  |||  beautiful. Perfect.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
N  |||  playing ON THE SCREEN.
E  |||  
N  |||  When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
N  |||  change. They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
N  |||  OWNER. Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
N  |||  faces, some opened-mouthed.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (ON SCREEN, approaching)
D  |||  Valarie, what are you running from?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (enigmatic smile)
D  |||  From Valarie.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out. Simone collapses to the
N  |||  ground.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (running to her)
D  |||  Valarie! No!
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
N  |||  while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth. Viktor finally
N  |||  musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  The same scene that played in the studio screening room.
N  |||  However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
N  |||  leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  -- Why are we here? Is that what
D  |||  you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
D  |||  here? No why. Just here.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying. Now even LAINEY is affected by
N  |||  Simone's performance. She wipes a tear from her eye.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
N  |||  audience reaction. Finally the credits roll.
E  |||  
N  |||  A dedication, "For HANK".
E  |||  
N  |||  No one moves from their seats. Viktor permits himself a
N  |||  brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
N  |||  credits:
E  |||  
N  |||  A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
E  |||  
N  |||  Still no one moves from their seats. Viktor cannot stand it
N  |||  any longer. He runs to the restroom.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
N  |||  water. He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
N  |||  reflection. He rehearses a courtroom speech.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
D  |||  may be guilty of a crime, but it
D  |||  was committed with the purest of
D  |||  intentions, to send a message to
D  |||  the acting community who put
D  |||  themselves above the work and
D  |||  above --
E  |||  
N  |||  Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom. They approach the
N  |||  urinals.
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
D  |||  (continuing their
D  |||  conversation from the
D  |||  lobby)
D  |||  -- So fake.
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
D  |||  -- Totally artificial.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
N  |||  the end of their conversation.
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
D  |||  We're really supposed to believe
D  |||  that was 19th Century Lisbon?
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
D  |||  Who's looking at the sets when she
D  |||  is on the screen?
E  |||  
N  |||  All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR exits the restroom. Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
N  |||  including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (pointing out her father)
D  |||  There he is. That's my dad, Viktor
D  |||  Taransky.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
N  |||  spontaneously applauds. They rush to shake his hand.
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
D  |||  -- She is magnificent.
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
D  |||  -- Absolutely unreal.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She wasn't too... cartoony?
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
D  |||  -- Who? The nun?
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 7
D  |||  -- Or are you talking about the
D  |||  mother?
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
D  |||  -- A star like that, who cares
D  |||  about the supporting cast?
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
D  |||  -- Congratulations again. She
D  |||  was... not of this earth. You
D  |||  should be very proud.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  "Not of this earth". A good way of
D  |||  putting it. And the film as a
D  |||  whole -- ?
E  |||  
N  |||  The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  She's a miracle, Dad. Where did
D  |||  you find her?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (vague)
D  |||  I saw her picture on the, er...
D  |||  internet.
D  |||  (interrogating his
D  |||  daughter's face)
D  |||  You really didn't notice anything --
D  |||  unusual?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Only her brilliance. To be honest,
D  |||  with what you had to work with, I
D  |||  was expecting a train wreck. You
D  |||  really pulled it off.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I have a feeling mom is going to
D  |||  take you back after this.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's head snaps around. Lainey smiles.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Back on the lot.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail.
N  |||  His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message
N  |||  light reads "FULL". He hits the "PLAY" button.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE (V.O.)
D  |||  Viktor, you bastard! I hear it's
D  |||  great.
D  |||  (beat)
D  |||  Seriously, I'm happy for you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine
N  |||  from happier times. He gazes at it as he listens to the
N  |||  message.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE (V.O.)
D  |||  I know people are going to be
D  |||  beating down your door but... well,
D  |||  I'd love the chance to buy back
D  |||  something I gave away for free.
D  |||  Don't you just love Hollywood?...
C  |||  BEEP.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor stops the machine, dazed. He idly opens his mail.
N  |||  Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's
N  |||  name, "SIMONE".
E  |||  
C  |||  A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
E  |||  
N  |||  A) A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown
N  |||  movie theater as far as the eye can see.

D  |||  (from TV)
D  |||  But who is Simone? We know so
D  |||  little about her. No details of
D  |||  her background have been released,
D  |||  not even her age. She is somewhere
D  |||  between a girl and a woman. A
D  |||  fresh face and familiar both at the
D  |||  same time.
E  |||  
N  |||  G) The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a
N  |||  multiplex. The marquee has 16 screens and looks like
N  |||  this:
E  |||  
D  |||  "SUNRISE, SUNSET" "SUNRISE, SUNSET"
D  |||  "SUNRISE, SUNSET" "SUNRISE, SUNSET"

E  |||  
C  |||  ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
D  |||  Is Simone even her real name? And
D  |||  why the secrecy? All we know for
D  |||  sure is that she was discovered by
D  |||  little-known director, Viktor
D  |||  Tarinsky.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,
N  |||  corrects the reporter.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
D  |||  (from the TV)
D  |||  He has parlayed his relationship
D  |||  with the new sensation into a three
D  |||  picture deal with the very studio
D  |||  that dumped him only six months
D  |||  ago. And no wonder with the
D  |||  starlet's performance breaking all
D  |||  box office records.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO GATE - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
N  |||  PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
N  |||  glimpse of SIMONE.
E  |||  
C  |||  MOB
D  |||  Simone! SIMONE! I LOVE YOU! I
D  |||  Want to BE you!
E  |||  
N  |||  Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
N  |||  lot.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
N  |||  limousine on the studio steps.
E  |||  
N  |||  A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready. A banner
N  |||  reads, "Welcome SIMONE". A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR steps out of the car. ELAINE pushes past him, into
N  |||  the limo.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Simone!... Simone?
E  |||  
N  |||  The car is empty.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (re-emerging from the car)
D  |||  Where is she?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Good to see you too, Elaine.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (ignoring his sarcasm)
D  |||  Why isn't she with you?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Why? Because she would never show
D  |||  up at something like this. She's
D  |||  intensely private.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine sighs, exasperated.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (dismissing her
D  |||  colleagues)
D  |||  Back to work, everyone. She's not
D  |||  here.
E  |||  
N  |||  The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Viktor... I want to thank you for
D  |||  convincing Simone to sign with the
D  |||  studio.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Don't thank me. It was entirely
D  |||  Simone's decision. Do you have
D  |||  Simone's check?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I don't have it on me. Anyway, it
D  |||  means a lot.
D  |||  (quickly changing tack)
D  |||  Have you read the reviews? They're
D  |||  love letters.
D  |||  (reading from a newspaper)
D  |||  Listen to this one. "Simone has
D  |||  the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
D  |||  the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
D  |||  of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
D  |||  face of Audrey Hepburn combined
D  |||  with an angel".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (musing to himself)
D  |||  Almost right.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I can't wait to meet her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I don't know if that's going to
D  |||  happen.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  Why not?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  As I say, she's... something of a
D  |||  recluse. That's how she's able to
D  |||  stay so pure -- by isolating
D  |||  herself in her art.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (face falling)
D  |||  Don't be ridiculous. I arranged a
D  |||  press conference.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Out of the question. A circus like
D  |||  that?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Viktor, it's my studio.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She's my actor. There are other
D  |||  studios, Elaine. There's only one
D  |||  Simone.
D  |||  (leaving her on the steps)
D  |||  Leave the press conference to me.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor strides up the studio steps. Elaine stares after her
N  |||  ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
N  |||  arrogance.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
N  |||  podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent
N  |||  fame by association.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (tapping the microphone)
D  |||  Is this on?
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 1
D  |||  Who are you?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Taransky, Viktor. T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
D  |||  V-i-k-t-o-r.
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 1
D  |||  Yeah, but -- who are you?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (patronizing smile)
D  |||  I am a two-time Academy Award
D  |||  nominated director with over
D  |||  eighteen films to my credit thus
D  |||  far including my latest release,
D  |||  "Sunrise, Sunset". Who are you?
E  |||  
N  |||  A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I will not be taking any questions.
D  |||  However I do have a statement to
D  |||  read on behalf of my leading lady,
D  |||  Simone.
D  |||  (reading from his
D  |||  statement)
D  |||  "To Whom It May Concern. I'm
D  |||  deeply grateful for the
D  |||  extraordinary public response to
D  |||  Mr. Taransky's film. At this time
D  |||  I will be conducting no interviews
D  |||  or making publicity appearances
D  |||  since I am really nothing without
D  |||  the beautiful worlds and characters
D  |||  Mr. Taransky creates for me. I
D  |||  politely request that the press
D  |||  respect my privacy and let the work
D  |||  speak for itself. All questions
D  |||  and inquiries should be directed to
D  |||  Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
D  |||  aspects of my career. Yours very
D  |||  truly, Simone".
E  |||  
N  |||  The reporters all call out at once.
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 2
D  |||  -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
D  |||  dating?
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 3
D  |||  -- Viktor, where'd you find her?
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 4
D  |||  -- Is Simone her real name?
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 5
D  |||  -- What's she got to hide?
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 1
D  |||  -- Is she the new Garbo?
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER 2
D  |||  -- Who's Garbo?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
N  |||  hands.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I thought I made it clear -- no
D  |||  questions regarding Simone.
D  |||  (bringing the press
D  |||  conference to a hasty
D  |||  conclusion)
D  |||  Now, I would like to close by
D  |||  announcing that Miss Simone begins
D  |||  production today on her next film,
D  |||  "Eternity Forever". This project
D  |||  has been near and dear to my heart
D  |||  since I wrote it nine years ago.
D  |||  (a tinge of bitterness,
D  |||  then a smile)
D  |||  I Thank you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor exits the podium. A voice stops him in his tracks.
E  |||  
C  |||  VOICE (O.S.)
D  |||  Who do you think you're fooling,
D  |||  Taransky?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor turns. The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
N  |||  truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
N  |||  by his assistant, MILTON.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Do I know you?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Max Sayer -- National Echo.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (regaining his composure,
D  |||  a smirk)
D  |||  Don't you have a real story to
D  |||  write? Why aren't you in Latin
D  |||  America?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  This is the story.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I remember when the Echo had class
D  |||  -- the paper that could bring down
D  |||  governments.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Our leaders aren't presidents
D  |||  anymore -- they're pop stars and
D  |||  screen idols. If Woodward and
D  |||  Bernstein were alive today, they'd
D  |||  be right here in Hollywood with me.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  They are alive, Sayer.
E  |||  
N  |||  Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  So they're probably here.
D  |||  (hardly missing a beat)
D  |||  You might be able to sell this
D  |||  'disappearing act' to the rest of
D  |||  the world, but I'm not buying it.
D  |||  What's really behind this Simone
D  |||  woman? The public has a right to
D  |||  know. Why is she staying out of
D  |||  sight? And why the hell is she
D  |||  with you? I don't want you to take
D  |||  this the wrong way, Viktor, but
D  |||  you're not exactly Cecil B.
D  |||  DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Maybe the reason she's with me is a
D  |||  little thing called integrity,
D  |||  Sayer. Look it up.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor walks away.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (calling after him)
D  |||  Oh, I know all about integrity. I
D  |||  know even more about persistence.
D  |||  Look that one up.
E  |||  
N  |||  Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
E  |||  
D  |||  "CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
D  |||  panning the entrance. A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
D  |||  nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
D  |||  cart, script in hand.
E  |||  
C  |||  SECURITY GUARD
D  |||  No one came in or went out just
D  |||  like you said, Mr. Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Good.
E  |||  
C  |||  SECURITY GUARD
D  |||  Is Miss Simone coming today?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She's already here. She arrived
D  |||  before you and she'll leave long
D  |||  after you've gone.
D  |||  (admonishing guard)
D  |||  Remember, under no circumstances
D  |||  are you or any other person to
D  |||  enter the set without my express
D  |||  permission.
E  |||  
C  |||  SECURITY GUARD
D  |||  What if it catches on fire?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Let it burn. Simone would rather
D  |||  go up in flames than give up her
D  |||  privacy.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
N  |||  the soundstage.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
N  |||  a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
N  |||  tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
N  |||  side monitors. VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to himself as he inserts
D  |||  his Hollywood hard-drive
D  |||  -- SIMULATION ONE)
D  |||  Pay no attention to the man behind
D  |||  the computer.
E  |||  
N  |||  A title appears on his computer screen.
E  |||  
N  |||  Welcome
N  |||  to
N  |||  SIMULATION ONE
E  |||  
N  |||  With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
N  |||  revises the title to:
E  |||  
N  |||  Welcome
N  |||  to
C  |||  SIMONE
E  |||  
N  |||  He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
N  |||  wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
N  |||  emerges -- SIMONE. She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
N  |||  blood actress.
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
N  |||  titled "VISUAL LOOP 6". Within the confines of the monitor
N  |||  she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal. She looks a
N  |||  little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
N  |||  too long.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to the screen)
D  |||  Good morning, Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  A star is...
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  ... digitized.
E  |||  
N  |||  Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
N  |||  into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
N  |||  key on his keyboard. When he speaks, she speaks. Simone's
N  |||  voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
N  |||  Viktor's voice. A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
N  |||  mimic his movements.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  You mean they buy it?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (nervous smile as he
D  |||  examines his first
D  |||  royalty check)
D  |||  Buy it? They're paying for it.
D  |||  And around here that's how you
D  |||  really know they buy it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
N  |||  the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
D  |||  see this.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  (depressing the button
D  |||  every time he wants to
D  |||  express his thoughts
D  |||  through Simone)
D  |||  Maybe he can.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Do you have any idea what this
D  |||  means, Simone? Our ability to
D  |||  manufacture fraud now exceeds our
D  |||  ability to detect it.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  (appearing to indulge
D  |||  Viktor with a smile)
D  |||  I am the death of real.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (pondering the enormity of
D  |||  the hoax)
D  |||  You are birth of... what? A
D  |||  Phenomenon. A miracle. A new era
D  |||  in show business. All I wanted to
D  |||  do was finish the film.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  And now look what you've started.
D  |||  And now look what you've started.
D  |||  And now look what you've started.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
N  |||  amusement. He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Hmm... a little less Streep, a
D  |||  little more Bacall.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
N  |||  dead, that comprise Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
N  |||  dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
N  |||  deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
E  |||  
N  |||  He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment. The
N  |||  voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
N  |||  representations of the sound waves.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Yes. Yes, it is.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself. He scrolls through the
N  |||  list of screen legends. He clicks on the image of AUDREY
C  |||  HEPBURN.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  While I think of it, I'd like you
D  |||  to add something to your repertoire
D  |||  -- remember that thing Hepburn does
D  |||  in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
E  |||  
N  |||  A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
N  |||  the screen. Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
E  |||  
C  |||  AUDREY HEPBURN
D  |||  (from the screen, an
D  |||  incomparable smile)
D  |||  Hi.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (pausing the moment)
D  |||  Let's hear you say "Hi" like
D  |||  Audrey.
E  |||  
N  |||  With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
N  |||  into a frozen Simone. Viktor presses play.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (imitating Audrey's
D  |||  performance perfectly)
D  |||  Hi.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Perfect.
D  |||  (stretching)
D  |||  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  You did create me.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No. I... just helped bring someone
D  |||  else's dream to life.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
D  |||  nothing without you. I was
D  |||  computer code -- ones and zeros.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You're right. You're right. Of
D  |||  course, one doesn't want to boast.
D  |||  It's a classic case of technology
D  |||  in search of an artist. That's all
D  |||  you've been waiting for, an artist
D  |||  with integrity, with a vision, who
D  |||  can see.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
N  |||  his theme. SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
N  |||  nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  See beyond that irrational
D  |||  allegiance to flesh and blood. --
D  |||  See that with the rise in price of
D  |||  a real actor and the fall in price
D  |||  of a fake, the scales have tipped
D  |||  in favor of the fake.
D  |||  (voice raising in
D  |||  excitement)
D  |||  -- See that if the performance is
D  |||  genuine, it doesn't matter if the
D  |||  actor is real. Once a performance
D  |||  is committed to film, the blood and
D  |||  bones are gone anyway. Only the
D  |||  spirit, the illusion remains.
D  |||  Besides, what's real anymore?
D  |||  These days most actors have digital
D  |||  work done to them so it's a gray
D  |||  area.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  (Simone appears to look
D  |||  directly at her maker)
D  |||  Are you ever going to tell the
D  |||  truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  The only real truth is in the work.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  You know what I'm talking about.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Yes. Yes, I'm going to tell the
D  |||  truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
D  |||  (pondering his own
D  |||  question)
D  |||  Of course, with Hank's tragic
D  |||  passing, the secret died with him.
D  |||  (shaking the thought from
D  |||  his head)
D  |||  I am going to tell the truth...
D  |||  after your next picture.
E  |||  
N  |||  Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject.
N  |||  He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Speaking of which -- this is the
D  |||  project I'd like you to do next.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Not, "Eternity Forever"? The
D  |||  legendary unproduced script that
D  |||  was too good ever to get made? I'd
D  |||  kill for that part.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I was hoping you'd say that.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
D  |||  Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (pretending to be hard of
D  |||  hearing)
D  |||  I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
D  |||  What did you say?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
D  |||  Taransky.
E  |||  
N  |||  On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
N  |||  RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button. He is
N  |||  unable to resist speaking another line.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  And I will never, ever leave you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
N  |||  until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
D  |||  "GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
D  |||  FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor comes close to the monitor. He notices something
N  |||  about Simone's face.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You're so beautiful. Too
D  |||  beautiful.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
N  |||  He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
E  |||  
N  |||  From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
N  |||  empty soundstage.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR's face against the SKY. As he walks, we reveal that
N  |||  the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
N  |||  studio lot -- behind a parking lot. Viktor hands his valet
N  |||  ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
E  |||  
C  |||  VALET MANAGER
D  |||  -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky.
D  |||  We gave you a complimentary car
D  |||  wash -- they're washing the engine
D  |||  now.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
N  |||  their cars under an umbrella. A young TALENT AGENT
N  |||  approaches.
E  |||  
C  |||  TALENT AGENT
D  |||  Viktor! Look, I'm sorry I didn't
D  |||  call you back last year. I was,
D  |||  er... out of the country.
D  |||  (strained moment)
D  |||  But we should get together. My
D  |||  schedule's wide open.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Sure, I'll... "call you".
E  |||  
N  |||  The agent's face falls. He gets in his car, disconsolate.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Hello, Hal.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  The film. The chemistry. No
D  |||  reflections on Nicola but Simone
D  |||  and I -- we were just so right
D  |||  together.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You never were together, Hal.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  And still the connection was
D  |||  undeniable.
D  |||  (aside)
D  |||  I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
D  |||  but I know it's brilliant. And I
D  |||  know I would be perfect for Clive.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (correcting him)
D  |||  Clyde.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Yes, perfect.
D  |||  (lowering his voice)
D  |||  As a matter of fact, I ran into
D  |||  Simone on the lot the other day.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (genuinely startled)
D  |||  Really? She didn't mention it.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (quickly covering)
D  |||  I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
D  |||  of people right now.
D  |||  (under his breath)
D  |||  She is just as you described her,
D  |||  Viktor... indescribable. I
D  |||  strongly sensed she thought I was
D  |||  right for it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
N  |||  his cell phone. The phone rings. Viktor feigns surprise and
N  |||  answers.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (answering the phone he
D  |||  has just dialed, louder
D  |||  than necessary)
D  |||  Hello?... SIMONE! How are you,
D  |||  sweetheart?
E  |||  
N  |||  A hush descends over the executives. Hal is suddenly very
N  |||  uncomfortable. Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
N  |||  conversation.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (winking to Hal)
D  |||  You'll never guess who I'm with...
D  |||  you ran into him on the lot.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  It was more in passing.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You're so far off!
D  |||  (finally chuckles)
D  |||  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
D  |||  star. Remember now?... No, I don't
D  |||  think he's put on weight.
D  |||  (a shrug of apology to the
D  |||  appalled Hal)
D  |||  Anyway, you think he's right for
D  |||  "Eternity Forever"?... not the
D  |||  right type?... a different
D  |||  direction...
D  |||  (covering phone, to Hal)
D  |||  I'll try to talk her into it.
E  |||  
N  |||  The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark. A
N  |||  mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
N  |||  into his car.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (into phone)
D  |||  ... Listen this is a bad place to
D  |||  talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
D  |||  you have charity work you want to
D  |||  do, I know you want to give back --
D  |||  but remember, your greatest gift is
D  |||  your talent... we'll talk about it
D  |||  at the beach house this weekend...
D  |||  I'm looking forward to it too.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor hangs up. His car pulls up. He tips extravagantly
N  |||  and drives away. The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
N  |||  phones.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
N  |||  windows.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. CAR - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Inside the car, MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON, scanner in
N  |||  hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a
N  |||  computer.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR'S VOICE
D  |||  (from the machine)
D  |||  -- "... You think he's right for
D  |||  "Eternity Forever"?... not the
D  |||  right type?... a different
D  |||  direction..."
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  (to Max, a shake of the
D  |||  head)
D  |||  I'm getting nothing from her side
D  |||  of the conversation.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Is it a jamming device?
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  Maybe he's talking to himself.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (dismissing the idea)
D  |||  Taransky isn't that good an actor.
D  |||  No, they're taking special
D  |||  precautions. Some kind of new
D  |||  encryption.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Why?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (musing)
D  |||  Whatever it is, it's dark.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Dark?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Yes, very.
E  |||  
N  |||  They continue listening to the recording.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR'S VOICE
D  |||  "... We'll talk about it at the
D  |||  beach house this weekend..."
E  |||  
N  |||  MAX's eyes light up. He gazes to a photo of SIMONE pasted to
N  |||  the inside of the car.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast. Lainey is in her pajamas,
N  |||  occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father
N  |||  prepares French toast.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (glancing to the computer)
D  |||  Can't you stop that?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Why?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Those things can be dangerous.
D  |||  Staring at a screen all day -- you
D  |||  miss what's going on outside in the
D  |||  real world. You can lose yourself.
D  |||  You should get out more. How are
D  |||  you going to meet boys?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (shrugs coyly, getting up)
D  |||  I know plenty of boys.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Really? Who? Where do you meet
D  |||  them? In a chat room? How do you
D  |||  know he's not some middle-aged
D  |||  freak?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak
D  |||  a mile away.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Okay. But you have to find a way
D  |||  to escape that thing.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I do.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  How?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I read.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You do? Still? I can't tell you
D  |||  how happy I am to hear that.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  You were the one who insisted on
D  |||  it. Reading me Dostoyevsky and
D  |||  Joyce when I was four.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You understood them. That's what
D  |||  was amazing.
D  |||  (looking out the window)
D  |||  It's a nice day. Let's eat
D  |||  outside.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door. We hear a
N  |||  chorus of CLICKS.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Actually, it may be nicer inside.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor joins her at the doorway.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Stay here, I'll deal with this.
E  |||  
N  |||  Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
N  |||  of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS. The next door houses
N  |||  have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
N  |||  the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
N  |||  waving extravagantly.
E  |||  
N  |||  Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
N  |||  nearby rooftop. The photographer limps towards the fence.
N  |||  Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
N  |||  and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
N  |||  relishing the attention.
E  |||  
N  |||  The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
N  |||  several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
E  |||  
C  |||  PHOTOGRAPHER 1
D  |||  That wasn't her, Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
D  |||  Where is she? You can't hide her
D  |||  forever.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (hurling the camera into
D  |||  the mob)
D  |||  You'll never find her. Simone only
D  |||  appears when I want her to appear.
E  |||  
N  |||  MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
N  |||  accompanied by assistant MILTON.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  She sounds like a prisoner,
D  |||  Taransky. Are you holding her
D  |||  hostage? Are you some kind of
D  |||  Svengali?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (recognizing the reporter)
D  |||  Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
D  |||  you? You look kind of "captive"
D  |||  yourself. While you're spending
D  |||  every waking hour obsessing over
D  |||  Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
D  |||  doesn't even know you exist. Get
D  |||  off my property or I'll call the
D  |||  cops.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  The cops? The cops read my column
D  |||  to know who to bust. We're the
D  |||  only watchdog the public has.
D  |||  (looking around at the
D  |||  photographers)
D  |||  None of this is going away. We'll
D  |||  be here tomorrow and the day after
D  |||  that. Until you slip up. And you
D  |||  will. You are looking at your
D  |||  shadow.
D  |||  (getting in his face)
D  |||  Because all these elaborate
D  |||  precautions with Simone -- every
D  |||  instinct in my body tells me, it's
D  |||  not natural.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm just trying to help you, Sayer.
D  |||  I don't want you to be
D  |||  disappointed. It gets cold out
D  |||  here at night.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Nice try. If we can't get to her
D  |||  through you, maybe your family will
D  |||  be more co-operative. I can
D  |||  guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
D  |||  another, Miss Simone and I are
D  |||  going to get acquainted.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (turning away)
D  |||  I'd like to see that, Sayer.
D  |||  Invite me.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR drives along a twisty mountain road, LAINEY in the
N  |||  passenger seat. They have become so blase about the
N  |||  paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle
N  |||  PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
E  |||  
C  |||  REPORTER (ON RADIO)
D  |||  -- The rumor is, Simone is holed up
D  |||  in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far
D  |||  we haven't seen so much as a
D  |||  glimpse --
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (switching off the radio)
D  |||  Honey, I'm really sorry about all
D  |||  this. I don't know if it's safe
D  |||  for you to stay the weekends...
D  |||  just until things settle down.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  Okay, Dad.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  If anyone asks about Simone --
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  -- I know, I don't know anything.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Exactly.
D  |||  (slightly irritated by her
D  |||  lack of interest)
D  |||  Don't you wonder where I'm really
D  |||  hiding Simone?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (looking to him)
D  |||  I'm sure you'd tell me if you
D  |||  thought it was important.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey gives her father a smile. Through the car window
N  |||  behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops
N  |||  down a bank.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion. LAINEY
N  |||  gives her father a kiss and departs. ELAINE, in the garden,
N  |||  overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (from the car)
D  |||  Sorry I didn't get her back in
D  |||  time.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  No problem.
D  |||  (she smiles)
D  |||  Do you want to come in?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (surprised -- pleasantly)
D  |||  Why not?
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where KENT
N  |||  is working on a computer. Kent smiles blandly.
E  |||  
C  |||  KENT
D  |||  Hey, Vik.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (disappointed to see him)
D  |||  Hello -- Kent.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room. Despite the eighty
N  |||  degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth.
N  |||  ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file. Viktor's face
N  |||  falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Viktor, we simply have to talk
D  |||  about "Eternity..."
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  "Forever".
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Whatever. I still haven't received
D  |||  Simone's script notes.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  There aren't any. If the
D  |||  filmmakers are happy, Simone's
D  |||  happy. She considers herself an...
D  |||  "instrument".
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Really? Oh, so she's really going
D  |||  to do all this nudity?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  If it's on the page...
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Well, something has to be done
D  |||  about this budget. It's completely
D  |||  unrealistic.
D  |||  (referring to a column in
D  |||  the budget)
D  |||  You allowed nothing for limousine
D  |||  service.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She'll drive herself.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Hair and make-up?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She'll do her own. Theater
D  |||  training.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  She was in the theater? When?
D  |||  Where?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'll send you her resume.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Al least a contingency for
D  |||  wardrobe. Any woman can go up a
D  |||  dress size.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- I guarantee she won't gain an
D  |||  once. She's very disciplined.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (concerned by an entry in
D  |||  the budget)
D  |||  Well, we have to do something about
D  |||  this -- "stuntwoman".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  What about it?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  There isn't one.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No need. She does all her own
D  |||  stunts.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (skeptical)
D  |||  Even the fall from the plane?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (nonchalant)
D  |||  Even the fall from the plane.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Well, shoot it on the last day.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  As I've tried to explain to you,
D  |||  Elaine. Simone isn't like any
D  |||  other actress you've ever known.
D  |||  She's about the work and only the
D  |||  work -- lives for the work. She
D  |||  wants all the money up there...
D  |||  (gazing into space)
D  |||  ... on the screen where it belongs.
D  |||  She'd work for scale except I know
D  |||  you only respect people you pay a
D  |||  fortune.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Which accounts for your percentage.
D  |||  (tossing the budget on the
D  |||  coffee table)
D  |||  When do I get to meet this dream?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Not today. She's learning her
D  |||  lines.
D  |||  (glancing to Elaine's
D  |||  budget)
D  |||  You can also take cue cards and
D  |||  teleprompter out of the budget.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (smiles)
D  |||  I'll walk you out.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE's demeanor softens. She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
N  |||  sympathetically.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
D  |||  you now, not as Elaine, studio
D  |||  head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
D  |||  (correcting herself)
D  |||  Second ex-wife. You got lucky this
D  |||  last time but you need to be
D  |||  careful. We both know you wouldn't
D  |||  be making this overblown art film
D  |||  of you hadn't convinced Simone to
D  |||  be in it.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Elaine, talking to you now, not as
D  |||  Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
D  |||  husband... what the hell happened
D  |||  to you?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (exasperated)
D  |||  Experience, Viktor. I've seen this
D  |||  a hundred times -- young stars
D  |||  destroying the very people who
D  |||  discovered them. I'm worried about
D  |||  you, that's all. This woman -- she
D  |||  controls your destiny.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Simone does not control my destiny.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Viktor, I have a feeling. One of
D  |||  my feelings. There's something
D  |||  about her I don't trust.
E  |||  
N  |||  From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY
N  |||  smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR enters his office where he's greeted by his assistant,
C  |||  JANE.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  (sheepish)
D  |||  Thanks for taking me back, Mr.
D  |||  Taransky. I know it looked like I
D  |||  sided with the studio, but I always
D  |||  believed in you, honestly.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Don't worry. I understand.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  (referring to the cast
D  |||  seated around a
D  |||  conference table)
D  |||  They're all here.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits at the head of the table, surrounded by HAL,
N  |||  LOTUS, MAC and three other CAST MEMBERS. A preliminary
N  |||  poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY
N  |||  FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I can't tell you how delighted I am
D  |||  to have this wonderful cast
D  |||  assembled for "Eternity Forever".
D  |||  Thank you all. Now, a reminder --
D  |||  as a condition for working on this
D  |||  film, you will not be rehearsing
D  |||  with Simone, shooting with Simone
D  |||  and you are forbidden from
D  |||  contacting Simone in any way at any
D  |||  time, whatsoever.
E  |||  
N  |||  The CAST nods seriously.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (a thought occurs)
D  |||  How will you do our love scenes?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Body double.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  For her?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  For you.
D  |||  (addressing the entire
D  |||  cast)
D  |||  I want you to know, Simone
D  |||  appreciates you all working for
D  |||  scale. But why am I thanking you?
D  |||  Simone can thank you herself. She
D  |||  insisted on speaking with you
D  |||  before filming begins. She's on
D  |||  the line now.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a
N  |||  red blinking light on the phone. The cast reacts excitedly.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (pushing a button on the
D  |||  phone)
D  |||  Simone, are you there?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (through the speakerphone)
D  |||  I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  LOTUS
D  |||  (unable to contain her
D  |||  excitement)
D  |||  So are we, Simone!
E  |||  
N  |||  Everyone laughs giddily.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE (O.S.)
D  |||  Why don't you leave me alone with
D  |||  my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we
D  |||  can get to know each other better?
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Good idea.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Of course. I'll be back in a
D  |||  minute.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor exits.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE (O.S.)
D  |||  Hi. Who's there? Don't be shy.
D  |||  Introduce yourselves.
E  |||  
N  |||  The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone. Mac breaks
N  |||  the silence.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAC
D  |||  I'm Mac. I turned down a
D  |||  Bertolucci film to be here.
E  |||  
C  |||  LOTUS
D  |||  My name's Lotus. God, I can't
D  |||  believe I'm talking to you. We're
D  |||  going to become such great friends.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  I'm Hal. Wonderful to be working
D  |||  together... again.
E  |||  
N  |||  The other cast members introduce themselves.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the
N  |||  nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital
N  |||  player, connected to a phone. Simone's pre-recorded opening
N  |||  remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost
N  |||  completed.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Is that everyone...?
D  |||  (pause)
D  |||  Well, obviously, as you know...
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time,
N  |||  speaking through the synthesizer. As usual, Viktor's voice
N  |||  is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  ... I'm Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (from Viktor's
D  |||  speakerphone)
D  |||  Obviously. Who else?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  (from speaker phone)
D  |||  I just want to start by apologizing
D  |||  for my "process" --
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The CAST are hunched over the speakerphone.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAC
D  |||  -- No. No. I'm completely
D  |||  simpatico. On my last film I was
D  |||  playing a schizophrenic so I made
D  |||  them give me two dressing rooms.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (an aside)
D  |||  So committed.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE (O.S.)
D  |||  Well thank you for your
D  |||  understanding. I know it's an
D  |||  unusual way to work but I just find
D  |||  I relate better to people when
D  |||  they're not actually there.
E  |||  
C  |||  LOTUS
D  |||  Of course, of course.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE (O.S.)
D  |||  I don't have much to say except
D  |||  that I know it's going to be a
D  |||  great project, if we all just trust
D  |||  Mr. Taransky's vision. Always do
D  |||  what Mr. Taransky says. If in
D  |||  doubt, do it the Taransky way.
E  |||  
N  |||  They all nod vigorously in agreement.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE (O.S.)
D  |||  I know we're going to make a
D  |||  wonderful movie together.
E  |||  
C  |||  LOTUS
D  |||  (nodding in agreement)
D  |||  Wonderful movie.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Together, absolutely.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage. A young
N  |||  cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart,
N  |||  tentatively approaches.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIVIAN
D  |||  Mr. Taransky...
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (referring to the stage)
D  |||  No one goes in there.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIVIAN
D  |||  Oh, I know.
E  |||  
N  |||  Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIVIAN
D  |||  If it's not too much trouble.
D  |||  Could you...?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Of course...
E  |||  
C  |||  VIVIAN
D  |||  (hesitant about broaching
D  |||  the subject)
D  |||  This last year I was... going
D  |||  through some things.
D  |||  (shaking her head at the
D  |||  memory)
D  |||  Awful, awful... things. But when I
D  |||  saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
D  |||  did... in the scene in the
D  |||  fireworks factory...
D  |||  (face lighting up)
D  |||  ... suddenly everything made sense.
D  |||  My friends, family, doctors --
D  |||  nobody could reach me -- but
D  |||  Simone, she really... spoke to me.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She'll be happy to sign it.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A green set. Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green. A FULL
N  |||  CAST shoots HAL, dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively
N  |||  crossing the green expanse.
E  |||  
N  |||  Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward.
N  |||  Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the
N  |||  ground.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR (O.S.)
D  |||  Cut! Cut!... Cut!
E  |||  
N  |||  Hal freezes. VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and
N  |||  confronts Hal on the green floor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Hal, what are you doing?
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Viktor, Clyde simply has to get
D  |||  close to Simone in this scene! He
D  |||  has to touch her. He has to!
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Absolutely not!
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  But she's right there! I must feel
D  |||  her!
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You can't.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Why not?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (struggling to find an
D  |||  excuse)
D  |||  There's... a wall between you --
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  -- an emotional wall, I know.
D  |||  That's why --
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- No. No. A real wall.
D  |||  (describing a wall with
D  |||  his hands within the
D  |||  green space)
D  |||  You ran right through it.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  How did the wall get there?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I can't explain it to you now --
D  |||  you'll see when it's all put
D  |||  together.
D  |||  (walking away)
D  |||  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes
D  |||  ago. Let's move on.
E  |||  
N  |||  Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor digitally adds SIMONE standing beside a sportscar with
N  |||  HAL in a scene from "Eternity Forever". He works on her
N  |||  close up.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (eyes welling with tears)
D  |||  -- What you don't understand,
D  |||  Clyde, is that love is like a wild
D  |||  flower, but that flower only
D  |||  grows --
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor hits STOP and Simone freezes. Viktor brings up a menu
N  |||  and chooses from a range of "EMOTIONAL OPTIONS".
E  |||  
C  |||  JOY SADNESS FEAR
D  |||  elated melancholy anxious
D  |||  jubilant tearful frightened
D  |||  giddy weeping petrified
D  |||  ecstatic blubbering loss of bladder
D  |||  inebriated Kevorkian control
E  |||  
C  |||  CONTEMPLATION INNOCENCE SENSUALITY
D  |||  reflective chaste seductive
D  |||  thoughtful virtuous lustful
D  |||  meditative angelic bestial
D  |||  stoic Madonna Madonna
D  |||  bored out of her [Blessed Virgin] [Like A Virgin]
D  |||  skull
E  |||  
N  |||  He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a
N  |||  performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Let's take it down a notch.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  -- What you don't understand --
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone freezes again. Viktor make another adjustment.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I like it. But still too big.
D  |||  (making a correction)
D  |||  Smaller teardrops next time.
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  It's not working. It's not alive.
D  |||  Let's try it again.
E  |||  
N  |||  She repeats the line. Viktor mimes the performance.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (teardrops arriving on
D  |||  cue)
D  |||  -- What you don't understand,
D  |||  Clyde, is that love is like a wild
D  |||  flower, but that flower only grows
D  |||  on the edge...
D  |||  (dramatic pause)
D  |||  ... of a very high cliff.
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone FREEZES.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Perfect, Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor returns SIMONE to her neutral background.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm only sorry you still have to
D  |||  work with flesh and blood for the
D  |||  time being -- as user friendly as
D  |||  you are, even I can't manufacture
D  |||  an entire cast.
E  |||  
D  |||  "To Vivian. Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity
D  |||  shot. He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
N  |||  she is waiting patiently, as usual.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  We are going to have to change our
D  |||  plans, Simone -- you have no idea
D  |||  what an affect your performance is
D  |||  having on people. We can't stop
D  |||  now. There's too much to say --
D  |||  these films they speak, they speak
D  |||  to the human condition. We're
D  |||  changing lives. No, revealing the
D  |||  truth now would be too cruel.
D  |||  (searching for more
D  |||  justification)
D  |||  Anyway, when you're seeking a
D  |||  greater truth -- in the work -- you
D  |||  are not so concerned with the
D  |||  lesser truths along the way.
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone doesn't appear convinced.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  You're going to get in a lot of
D  |||  trouble, Mr. Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (irritated at her pricking
D  |||  his conscience)
D  |||  Why do you have to bring that up?
D  |||  There's always risk -- life's a
D  |||  risk. It's worth it. Besides, how
D  |||  could something so lovely be a
D  |||  crime?
D  |||  (regarding her tenderly)
D  |||  Well, I think we've done enough for
D  |||  today. You've been cooped up in
D  |||  there too long. How about you and
D  |||  me go out on the town? They're
D  |||  expecting us.
E  |||  
N  |||  He turns to a copy of "The Echo". A photo of Viktor at the
N  |||  gate of his Malibu home. "SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self
N  |||  proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight". Viktor
N  |||  puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an
N  |||  opulent hotel. He approached the CONCIERGE.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm checking in a special guest...
D  |||  (obviously conspiratorial)
D  |||  ... Miss Enomis.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy
N  |||  of "Variety". Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails
N  |||  To Three Picture Deal".
E  |||  
C  |||  CONCIERGE
D  |||  Miss Enomis, yes.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Miss Enomis demands her privacy.
D  |||  You will switch off all
D  |||  surveillance cameras. I will
D  |||  escort Miss Enomis to her room
D  |||  alone via the rear exit. She will
D  |||  require no help with her luggage.
D  |||  She does not wish to be disturbed
D  |||  at any time for any reason. She
D  |||  will be departing for a function
D  |||  tonight at eight sharp.
D  |||  (tipping him with a
D  |||  hundred dollar bill)
D  |||  I'm sure I can rely on your
D  |||  discretion. Do you understand?
E  |||  
C  |||  CONCIERGE
D  |||  (passing the key to
D  |||  Viktor)
D  |||  Oh, I understand.
E  |||  
N  |||  As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card
N  |||  to the mirror.
E  |||  
N  |||  ENOMIS becomes SIMONE.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Concierge picks up his phone.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR enters the hotel suite. We see a montage of scenes --
N  |||  Viktor revelling in his masquerade.
E  |||  
N  |||  A) VIKTOR pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in
N  |||  the sheets to give it a slept-in look.
E  |||  
N  |||  B) VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
E  |||  
N  |||  C) VIKTOR tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet.
E  |||  
N  |||  D) VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
E  |||  
N  |||  E) VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
E  |||  
N  |||  F) VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
E  |||  
N  |||  G) In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
N  |||  a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
N  |||  rocket.
E  |||  
N  |||  H) VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
N  |||  scatters it on the counter.
E  |||  
N  |||  I) VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
N  |||  bouncing into the toilet bowl. He retrieves it.
E  |||  
N  |||  J) VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
N  |||  jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
N  |||  rear entrance.
E  |||  
N  |||  K) VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
N  |||  shadow on the drapes. A "walking" silhouette is visible
N  |||  to the media on the street.
E  |||  
N  |||  L) VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
N  |||  LOVE YOU V--".
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR is interrupted by a knock on the door. He looks at
N  |||  his watch.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (peering through the
D  |||  peephole)
D  |||  Who is it?
E  |||  
C  |||  WOMAN'S VOICE
D  |||  (from other side of door)
D  |||  It's... Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor smiles.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
N  |||  YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head. A HOTEL DOORMAN
N  |||  keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's limousine waits at the curb. The coated woman
N  |||  starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Not yet.
D  |||  (scrutinizing the crowd)
D  |||  Where's "Matinee"? There they are.
D  |||  Okay, I think everyone's here.
D  |||  Now!
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
N  |||  providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
N  |||  paparazzi.
E  |||  
C  |||  PHOTOGRAPHER 1
D  |||  Simone!
E  |||  
C  |||  ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
D  |||  Over here, sweetheart!
E  |||  
C  |||  PHOTOGRAPHER 3
D  |||  Come one Simone, take it off, baby!
E  |||  
C  |||  PHOTOGRAPHER 4
D  |||  We got a job to do!
E  |||  
N  |||  The car door slams shut as the pack descends. MAX SAYER and
N  |||  MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters. The limo
N  |||  screeches away. A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
N  |||  following.
E  |||  
N  |||  The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
E  |||  
C  |||  PHOTOGRAPHER 1
D  |||  I think I got a piece of her ear.
E  |||  
C  |||  ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
D  |||  I didn't get shit.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  (emerging from the pack,
D  |||  to Max)
D  |||  Ten feet from a living Goddess...
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. MISS ENOMIS'S HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  MAX SAYER pays off the CONCIERGE. His assistant, MILTON,
N  |||  begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for
N  |||  fingerprints, etc. Max rubs pencil into the impression on
N  |||  the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of
N  |||  life is that it ends".
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (interrupting Milton's
D  |||  work)
D  |||  Leave me for a moment.
E  |||  
N  |||  Milton and the Concierge depart.
E  |||  
N  |||  Max is alone. He looks around the room.
E  |||  
N  |||  A) MAX enters the bathroom. He picks up a drinking glass
N  |||  and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed
N  |||  plastic bag.
E  |||  
N  |||  B) MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
N  |||  it in a plastic bag.
E  |||  
N  |||  C) MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
N  |||  before placing it in a plastic bag.
E  |||  
N  |||  D) MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
E  |||  
N  |||  E) MAX enters the bedroom. He carefully removes a slip from
N  |||  a pillow. He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
N  |||  in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
E  |||  
N  |||  F) Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed.
N  |||  He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same
N  |||  sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  MILTON, ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR TARANSKY'S LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI
N  |||  in their wake. Viktor gently removes the coat from over her
N  |||  head.
E  |||  
N  |||  Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not
N  |||  Simone. FAITH is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy. Viktor
N  |||  and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
N  |||  limousine.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (not quite able to avert
D  |||  his eyes from her
D  |||  telescopic legs)
D  |||  Thank God for you, Faith. I know
D  |||  this is above and beyond the call
D  |||  of duty for a stand-in. You don't
D  |||  know what a service you're
D  |||  performing for Simone -- shielding
D  |||  her from those animals.
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  No, thank God for you, Mr.
D  |||  Taransky. How many men would go
D  |||  to so much trouble to protect a
D  |||  woman?
E  |||  
N  |||  Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their
N  |||  intimate position.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You understand you'll have to come
D  |||  back to my place to keep them off
D  |||  the, er...
D  |||  (his nose close to Faith's
D  |||  neck)
D  |||  ... scent.
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  Of course.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (meeting her gaze)
D  |||  You look so, so...
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  ... so much like her?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Yes, of course, but very beautiful
D  |||  in your own right.
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  I do find myself physically
D  |||  attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
E  |||  
N  |||  Their lips are now tantalizingly close.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Viktor.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR'S HEAD hits the sofa in his living room, closely
N  |||  followed by FAITH on top of him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous. Viktor
N  |||  hardly resists. In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith
N  |||  murmurs in his ear.
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  Do whatever you do to Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor freezes.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  What?... What did you say?
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  Do what you do to Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  What I do to Simone?
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  Yes, call me Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Simone?
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  (still tearing at his
D  |||  clothes)
D  |||  Yes, yes, again, again. Do what
D  |||  you do to Simone. I want to know
D  |||  what it's like to be her just for
D  |||  one night.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  You're with me to be close to her?
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  (panting)
D  |||  Is that a problem?
E  |||  
N  |||  As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's
N  |||  deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset".
E  |||  
C  |||  FAITH
D  |||  "Why are we here? Is that what
D  |||  you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
D  |||  here? No why. Just here".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (this is too much for
D  |||  Viktor)
D  |||  Please put your clothes on
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to
N  |||  straighten her clothes.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
N  |||  ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY. As usual, they are mesmerized
N  |||  by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE. The scene ends. The
N  |||  light go up.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood
D  |||  Foreign Press is going to eat this
D  |||  up.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Thank you.
D  |||  (turning to his daughter)
D  |||  What did you think, Lainey?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  One thing bothered me.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  No, not that. I was just wondering
D  |||  -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
D  |||  why did Simone have no reflection
D  |||  when she walked in front of that
D  |||  mirror?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor is shocked, busted. He covers it with a laugh.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (ashen-faced)
D  |||  I wondered if you'd spot that.
D  |||  You've got a good eye, Lainey. I'm
D  |||  proud of you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I got them to remove the
D  |||  reflection. The mirror's metaphor
D  |||  -- to show how her character's
D  |||  inwardly dead.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  That's genius, Viktor. Was that
D  |||  Simone's idea?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (sarcastic, annoyed at the
D  |||  suggestion)
D  |||  Who else? It's always Simone's
D  |||  idea.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (not quite convinced)
D  |||  So that accounts for the lack of a
D  |||  shadow in reel six?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Precisely.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
N  |||  outside the theater.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (as she gets into the car)
D  |||  Good-night, Daddy.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (kissing Lainey good-bye)
D  |||  Night, Lainey.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (drawing Elaine aside)
D  |||  Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
D  |||  idea for Lainey to come to the
D  |||  screenings -- mature content and
D  |||  all that.
E  |||  
N  |||  Both look to Lainey. From inside the car Lainey watches her
N  |||  parents.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (impressed by his
D  |||  responsible attitude)
D  |||  Maybe you're right.
D  |||  (gently teasing)
D  |||  Twelve years after your daughter's
D  |||  born you decide to become a father.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Better late than never.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (softening)
D  |||  I should fire you more often. The
D  |||  film's looking wonderful.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You really think so?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Yes. To be honest I never quite
D  |||  saw this film before -- maybe it's
D  |||  the way Simone is playing it -- but
D  |||  what it's saying about the illusion
D  |||  of permanence in everyday life, how
D  |||  that's the only way we can love --
D  |||  I think it's really going to mean
D  |||  something.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Thank you. I'll tell Simone you
D  |||  liked it.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I'd love to tell her myself.
D  |||  (cajoling)
D  |||  When are you going to let me meet
D  |||  her?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Soon. Soon.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Everyone I know has met her,
D  |||  Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Everyone you know is lying.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (amused)
D  |||  That's true.
E  |||  
N  |||  They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before.
N  |||  However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
N  |||  shutter from a nearby bush.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Damnit!
E  |||  
N  |||  The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  You know how you can stop that.
D  |||  She has to get out more.
D  |||  (climbing into the car)
D  |||  See you at the premiere.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. PREMIERE - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
N  |||  hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET". Red carpet, klieg lights
N  |||  searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
E  |||  
N  |||  A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out. The
N  |||  crowd screams with excitement.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor waves. Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
N  |||  their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
N  |||  car door... but nothing. The door shuts. A disappointed
N  |||  murmer. The limo drives off.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
E  |||  
C  |||  PREMIERE REPORTER 1
D  |||  (talking to camera)
D  |||  -- What a night! Anyone who's
D  |||  anyone is here at the premiere of
D  |||  "Eternity Forever," but waiting for
D  |||  Simone to show may take even
D  |||  longer. We do have her director,
D  |||  Viktor Taransky.
D  |||  (ushering him over)
D  |||  Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (slightly irritated by the
D  |||  focus on the star)
D  |||  You know Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Other reporters force their way into the interview.
E  |||  
C  |||  PREMIERE REPORTER 2
D  |||  I hope she does show up. Some of
D  |||  her fans got here at dawn. We
D  |||  don't want to disappoint them.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (through a pained smile)
D  |||  Well, I'm sure they're going to
D  |||  love the movie. I got the
D  |||  inspiration --
E  |||  
N  |||  However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
E  |||  
C  |||  PREMIERE REPORTER 2
D  |||  HARRY EPSON!
E  |||  
N  |||  The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor. Screen idol, HARRY
N  |||  EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
E  |||  
C  |||  PREMIERE REPORTER 2
D  |||  Harry! Harry! Can we have a
D  |||  minute? What brings you here
D  |||  tonight?
E  |||  
C  |||  HARRY
D  |||  (waving to the fans)
D  |||  I just came out to support my good
D  |||  friend, Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  PREMIERE REPORTER 2
D  |||  There's a rumor that you're more
D  |||  than just "good friends"?
E  |||  
C  |||  HARRY
D  |||  (slightly irritated by the
D  |||  invasion)
D  |||  We've been seeing each other, sure,
D  |||  but we'd rather keep our
D  |||  relationship private.
E  |||  
C  |||  PREMIERE REPORTER 2
D  |||  (believing she has a
D  |||  scoop)
D  |||  Do I hear the sound of... wedding
D  |||  bells?
E  |||  
C  |||  HARRY
D  |||  (suddenly losing it)
D  |||  I can't believe you people! No
D  |||  wonder she never comes to these
D  |||  things!
E  |||  
N  |||  Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
N  |||  carpet.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  A packed, glitzy party. VIKTOR enters without an escort.
N  |||  Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
N  |||  alone.
E  |||  
N  |||  He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
N  |||  schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
E  |||  
C  |||  MOVER/SHAKER
D  |||  Elaine! The picture is a
D  |||  revelation!
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Thank you. I mean, it was a team
D  |||  effort --
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
N  |||  pocket camera. Elaine is unaware of the shot.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor picks up a drink from the bar. A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
N  |||  unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
N  |||  Daniels. She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
N  |||  glasses off the bar. Viktor catches it.
E  |||  
N  |||  A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder. HAL stands there
N  |||  accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Is she here?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (oblivious to his sarcasm)
D  |||  Somebody said she was here.
E  |||  
N  |||  Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
N  |||  lipstick-smeared.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAC
D  |||  Oh my God, that's her glass!
D  |||  (impulsively smelling
D  |||  "Simone's" glass)
D  |||  Jack Daniels, straight-up. She is
D  |||  my kind of woman.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (looking anxiously around
D  |||  the room)
D  |||  Viktor, where is she?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She's around.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAC
D  |||  (dawning on him, glancing
D  |||  to the far side of the
D  |||  packed room)
D  |||  Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
D  |||  Room.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  You know I sometimes forget she has
D  |||  bodily functions.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (unable to resist)
D  |||  I know what you mean.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (anxiously looking to the
D  |||  restroom)
D  |||  I have to talk to her about my
D  |||  experimental film. It's very...
D  |||  experimental.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAC
D  |||  Is that her? -- By the fountain.
E  |||  
N  |||  Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
N  |||  her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (testy)
D  |||  No. In fact, between us, she
D  |||  doesn't really exist.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (ignoring him, calling out
D  |||  to the woman)
D  |||  Simone!
E  |||  
C  |||  MAC
C  |||  SIMONE!
E  |||  
N  |||  Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear. They talk
N  |||  over each other.
E  |||  
C  |||  GUEST 1
D  |||  -- Simone's here!
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (slightly the worse for
D  |||  drink)
D  |||  -- When did she arrive? Why didn't
D  |||  someone tell me?
E  |||  
C  |||  GUEST 2
D  |||  -- Where is she?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAC
D  |||  -- She's by the fountain.
E  |||  
C  |||  GUEST 3
D  |||  -- Simone, over here!
E  |||  
C  |||  GUEST 4
D  |||  -- Simone!
E  |||  
N  |||  The rumor races through the party like wild-fire. The GUESTS
N  |||  surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
E  |||  
C  |||  LOOKALIKE WOMAN
D  |||  Simone!
E  |||  
N  |||  She gets knocked into the fountain. Several other GUESTS
N  |||  also fall in the stampede.
E  |||  
N  |||  Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
N  |||  his station. Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.

E  |||  
N  |||  The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
N  |||  with ambulances. PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
N  |||  battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
E  |||  
C  |||  ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
D  |||  (into microphone)
D  |||  -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
D  |||  big news tonight was the surprise
D  |||  appearance of Simone. Even these
D  |||  seen-it-all superstars are
D  |||  apparently not immune to Simone
D  |||  fever and the resulting stampede
D  |||  forced organizers to bring the
D  |||  event to an early end. I spoke
D  |||  with some of the departing guests
D  |||  about their encounter with
D  |||  Hollywood's most reluctant
D  |||  superstar.

D  |||  believe her.
E  |||  
C  |||  MALE GUEST 1
D  |||  -- I can't reveal what we spoke
D  |||  about. It was... personal. Simone
D  |||  and I go back a long way.
E  |||  
C  |||  FEMALE GUEST 1
D  |||  -- When she talks to you, for that
D  |||  moment, you are the only other
D  |||  human being in the room.
E  |||  
C  |||  FEMALE GUEST 2
D  |||  (dress torn)
D  |||  -- I really don't know what the
D  |||  fuss is about. So over-rated.
D  |||  She's done one film. Talk to me
D  |||  when she's had the kind of career
D  |||  I've had.
E  |||  
C  |||  MALE GUEST 2
D  |||  -- I do expect her to be nominated,
D  |||  yes.

N  |||  Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ECHO OFFICES - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated. He paces back
N  |||  and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  -- She goes to a major, Hollywood,
D  |||  A-list party and we don't get an
D  |||  interview, a comment, we don't even
D  |||  get a photograph? Is that what
D  |||  you're telling me?
E  |||  
C  |||  ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
D  |||  Nobody got a photograph. Nobody
D  |||  ever gets a photograph.

D  |||  We've got our best people on it,

D  |||  24-hour tail on Taransky?
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Shutter bugs camped outside any
D  |||  place he goes, every concierge and
D  |||  maitre d' on the take. But this
D  |||  Simone woman is good.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (referring to a
D  |||  "Confidential" FBI
D  |||  report)
D  |||  Obviously the name isn't real --
D  |||  she's using an assumed identity,
D  |||  travels under a false name, checks
D  |||  into hotels with an alias. She
D  |||  never stays in the same place two
D  |||  nights in a row. Anything on the
D  |||  satellite photos?
D  |||  (irritated)
D  |||  What about the fingerprints? What
D  |||  happened when we dusted that hotel
D  |||  suite?
E  |||  
N  |||  MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Well, we got some of Taransky's
D  |||  fingerprints, a lot of your
D  |||  fingerprints... but none of hers.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (interest piqued)
D  |||  Which means they're significant.
D  |||  (beat)
D  |||  Incriminating.
D  |||  (beat)
D  |||  Perhaps, criminal.
D  |||  (getting excited)
D  |||  She's hiding her past. She's
D  |||  hiding her past.
E  |||  
N  |||  Max ponders the revelation.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Of course -- no one's that perfect,
D  |||  that pure. You know I had
D  |||  something on Mother Teresa. But
D  |||  then she died and it wasn't worth
D  |||  it anymore.
D  |||  (approaching a computer)
D  |||  I know how to flush out this Simone
D  |||  -- a tell-all story from her
D  |||  childhood.
E  |||

D  |||  (impressed)
D  |||  My God, you've got one?
E  |||

D  |||  (offering Milton a seat in
D  |||  front of the computer)
D  |||  I will when you're finished writing
D  |||  it.
E  |||  
N  |||  MILTON hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (disappointed in his
D  |||  protege)
D  |||  Am I wasting my time with you?
D  |||  When she sues to protect her
D  |||  privacy, she'll have to appear in a
D  |||  public courtroom to do it.

D  |||  headline on the cover of The ECHO. VIKTOR is reading the
D  |||  magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
E  |||  
N  |||  He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
N  |||  soundstage. A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
N  |||  trying to break into the "CLOSED SET". VIKTOR runs towards
N  |||  the door, throwing himself between the door and the
N  |||  executives.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- You can't go in there!
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE

E  |||

E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- She has to get out there and
D  |||  sell the film.
E  |||

D  |||  -- What do you want her to do, go
D  |||  door-to-door -- ?
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 1
D  |||  -- Even Garbo would be on the talk
D  |||  show circuit if she was alive
D  |||  today.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (irritated)
D  |||  -- It's precisely because she
D  |||  doesn't crave the limelight that
D  |||  people love her. I told you, she's
D  |||  only about the work.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 3
D  |||  -- This is over-shadowing the work!
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 2
D  |||  (waving the front page of
D  |||  The Echo)
D  |||  That's the problem. She's more
D  |||  famous for her no-shows than her
D  |||  shows.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- It's starting to look like she
D  |||  doesn't support the film or you,
D  |||  Viktor.
D  |||  (trying to squeeze past
D  |||  Viktor)
D  |||  If you can't handle her, I will.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (blocking her path)
D  |||  Not now. She's emotional. Her
D  |||  mother dies today. Scene forty-two
D  |||  of "Good For Nothing". It's not a
D  |||  good time.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
N  |||  Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No! Please, don't go in there!
E  |||  
N  |||  Too late. Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted
N  |||  with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the
N  |||  vast soundstage. A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 1
D  |||  Where is she?
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 2
D  |||  She's not here.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Elaine... I...
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing
N  |||  smile.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  So, the secret's finally out,
D  |||  Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- I can explain.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- I don't think that's necessary.
D  |||  I think it's perfectly clear. I
D  |||  should have guessed -- it all makes
D  |||  sense now... it's why she never
D  |||  goes anywhere, never seen in
D  |||  public...
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  She's into computers.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor looks up.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 1
D  |||  (nodding in agreement)
D  |||  Probably spends her whole life in
D  |||  chat rooms.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 2
D  |||  It's the one place she can be
D  |||  herself.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 3
D  |||  Anonymous.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (adopting a serious tone)
D  |||  It's worse than you think. She's
D  |||  extremely agoraphobic -- has a
D  |||  morbid fear of people and germs.
D  |||  In a way I'm relieved you... found
D  |||  out.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  The premiere was the first time
D  |||  I've convinced her to venture out
D  |||  and it just confirmed her worst
D  |||  nightmares.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (concerned)
D  |||  Viktor, you should have said
D  |||  something.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She doesn't want pity.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (seeing a new side of
D  |||  Viktor)
D  |||  You're so good to protect her like
D  |||  this.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor shrugs modestly.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to the Executives,
D  |||  conceding)
D  |||  I'll tell you what. I know how
D  |||  much this means to you. I'll try
D  |||  to get her to plug the film.
D  |||  (beat)
D  |||  I'm not promising anything but
D  |||  maybe she'll do a talk show --
D  |||  taped.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'll try. Maybe live but remote.
D  |||  She'll never go to them.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 1
D  |||  We understand. Thank you, Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 2
D  |||  Give her our best.
E  |||  
N  |||  Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the
N  |||  soundstage.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 1
D  |||  (aside to a colleague)
D  |||  That agoraphobia -- it's like a
D  |||  plague.
E  |||  
C  |||  EXECUTIVE 2
D  |||  It's out of control in Europe.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
D  |||  introduce you to Simone at the
D  |||  premiere. There wasn't time with
D  |||  the riot and everything.
D  |||  (picking up a framed photo
D  |||  from the work station)
D  |||  But she wanted you to have this.
E  |||  
N  |||  The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the
N  |||  premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  She was there. She didn't by any
D  |||  chance happen to mention me?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She said you were very beautiful.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (flattered)
D  |||  Really?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (blurting out)
D  |||  Elaine, what are you doing tonight?
D  |||  Would you like to go somewhere --
D  |||  dinner?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I'd love to. But aren't you
D  |||  supposed to meet up with Simone?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Oh, yes. Of course. Don't I
D  |||  always?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National
N  |||  ECHO -- the headline, "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF
N  |||  SIMONE"! Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter MAX
C  |||  SAYER.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods
N  |||  aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us.
E  |||  
N  |||  We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while
N  |||  at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV.
N  |||  However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart. She wears
N  |||  sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf. Simone takes
N  |||  a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of
N  |||  cereal off a display.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ECHO OFFICES - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  MAX SAYER watches the video in his office, enraptured. He
N  |||  rewinds the tape and replays the moment.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  She likes Apple Jacks... just like
D  |||  me...
E  |||  
N  |||  Assistant MILTON enters. He looks ill.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Mr. Sayer...
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (irritated at being
D  |||  interrupted)
D  |||  What do you want -- ?
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million
D  |||  bucks yet?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (never averting his eyes
D  |||  from the screen)
D  |||  -- Cashier's check went out to our
D  |||  anonymous tipster this morning --
D  |||  worth every penny too. Who says
D  |||  there's no place for checkbook
D  |||  journalism? We'll be running
D  |||  stills of this for months, then
D  |||  release the whole tape -- we'll get
D  |||  our money back -- maybe show it on
D  |||  an exclusive pay-per-view event.
D  |||  Do you realize what we have here?
D  |||  We have the only independent
D  |||  footage of Simone in existence.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  We used to.
E  |||  
N  |||  Max's head snaps around.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  (holding a copy of the
D  |||  L.A. Times Calendar
D  |||  section - "Simone Live")
D  |||  She's doing Frank Brand on
D  |||  Thursday.
E  |||  
N  |||  Max coughs.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Get out.
E  |||  
C  |||  A TV
E  |||  
N  |||  The opening credits to "FRANK BRAND LIVE", a global cable
N  |||  show plays against a starscape -- images of famous
N  |||  politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  (to camera)
D  |||  Tonight on Frank Brand Live --
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's
N  |||  mansion with eager anticipation.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  -- Since taking the nation by storm
D  |||  with her debut movie, "Sunrise,
D  |||  Sunset"...
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  ... no one's managed to land a live
D  |||  TV interview with the fabulous, new
D  |||  shooting starlet, Simone... until
D  |||  now.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
N  |||  from The ECHO.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
N  |||  final test of his equipment. When he touches his hair, bats
N  |||  his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
N  |||  SIMONE from a library of images. Rainforest. Desert. Ritzy
N  |||  hotel suite. Moonscape. Factory.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Make up your mind, Viktor. Make up
D  |||  your mind.
E  |||  
N  |||  He settles on the desert location.
E  |||  
N  |||  He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --
N  |||  selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  I'm happy to say she's agreed to
D  |||  join us tonight from the set of her
D  |||  new film.
D  |||  (turning to the TV
D  |||  monitor)
D  |||  Welcome, Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's
N  |||  monitor.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that
N  |||  Elaine is in the room.
E  |||  
C  |||  KENT
D  |||  She is all woman.
E  |||  
N  |||  LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look. She
N  |||  gets up and leaves the room.
E  |||  
N  |||  During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,
N  |||  Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including
N  |||  Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide
N  |||  locations --
E  |||  
N  |||  A) A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
E  |||  
N  |||  B) A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
E  |||  
N  |||  C) A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  Well, no one could accuse you of
D  |||  being over-exposed, Simone. Why
D  |||  have you stayed so completely out
D  |||  of the limelight?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (shrugs)
D  |||  I just think actors talk too much.
D  |||  Does the world really want to hear
D  |||  your life story just because you've
D  |||  got a movie opening Friday?
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  Of course, the only problem with
D  |||  shying away from publicity these
D  |||  days is that it tends to attract
D  |||  more.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
N  |||  frighteningly convincing.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (from TV)
D  |||  Don't I know it. That's the only
D  |||  reason I'm here now -- to put the
D  |||  attention back where it belongs, on
D  |||  Mr. Taransky's film.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  You don't secretly want the
D  |||  attention?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I'm not even sure I deserve it.
D  |||  After tonight I'll have almost as
D  |||  much screen time on your show as I
D  |||  do in my movies. How is that
D  |||  healthy for a performer?
E  |||  
C  |||  IE. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to
N  |||  look through a book.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (from TV)
D  |||  Because, you have to understand,
D  |||  Frank, these interviews -- none of
D  |||  this is real. Who I am on screen
D  |||  and who I really am are two totally
D  |||  different people.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  Who are you really?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  That's a good question.
D  |||  (beat)
D  |||  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man
D  |||  strives long and hard to appear
D  |||  someone else..."
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (reading from a bookmarked
D  |||  page, along with Simone)
D  |||  "... he ends up finding it is
D  |||  difficult to be himself again."
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  Well put.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor
N  |||  Taransky".
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
N  |||  leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (focusing on the desert
D  |||  background behind Simone)
D  |||  I know where that is... I know...
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  Change of topic. Simone, you've
D  |||  been romantically linked to dozens
D  |||  of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,
D  |||  Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...
D  |||  and most recently Viktor Taransky.
D  |||  Is there a Mr. Right in there
D  |||  somewhere?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I'd rather not discuss my private
D  |||  life.
D  |||  (gently)
D  |||  But Viktor and I are inseparable.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.
E  |||  
C  |||  KENT
D  |||  You dog, Viktor!
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (from TV)
D  |||  I literally wouldn't be here today
D  |||  without him.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
N  |||  excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command. SIMONE'S
N  |||  EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  Would you like a moment, Simone?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
N  |||  startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  No, I'm okay.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  Let's talk about the work that you
D  |||  care so much about.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Sure. Where would you like to
D  |||  start?
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  How about the nudity?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Nudity has just never been an issue
D  |||  for me, Frank. For me, clothes are
D  |||  just an option.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  What exactly was it that attracted
D  |||  you to your first two projects?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (unable to resist a smile)
D  |||  I suppose the thing I like most
D  |||  about the movies I'm in is that
D  |||  they're not about special effects.
E  |||  
N  |||  Frank nods sagely.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  They're better for it if I may say.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking
N  |||  alert:
E  |||  
C  |||  !!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
E  |||  
N  |||  The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up. Curiously, it
N  |||  is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  (regarding the screen)
D  |||  Well, we appear to be experiencing
D  |||  satellite difficulties. In case we
D  |||  lose you, Simone, I want to thank
D  |||  you --
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Thank... YOU, FRANK.
E  |||  
N  |||  In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug. The feed goes
N  |||  blank on Frank Brand's screen.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion. Since SIMONE
N  |||  is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
N  |||  Simone also slumps.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's cell phone rings. Viktor picks up.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR / SIMONE
D  |||  Hel--
E  |||  
N  |||  He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
N  |||  synthesizer.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (into phone)
D  |||  Hello.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
N  |||  the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
N  |||  TV.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- Viktor, are you with her? Is
D  |||  she there?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No.
E  |||  
N  |||  An anxious beat.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Are you and Simone...
D  |||  (blurting it out)
D  |||  ... getting married?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (taken aback by the
D  |||  suggestion)
D  |||  No, of course not!
D  |||  (realizing the
D  |||  significance of the
D  |||  question)
D  |||  Why? Would you care if we were?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (covering, realizing she
D  |||  has given herself away)
D  |||  Well, yes. From a studio point of
D  |||  view, it would be better if Simone
D  |||  stayed single.
D  |||  (quick change of topic)
D  |||  Anyhow, I thought she came across
D  |||  great tonight. Intelligent, well
D  |||  informed, a natural. And touching.
D  |||  She was spectacular.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Thank you.
E  |||  
N  |||  A pause.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Viktor, do you realize you always
D  |||  do that?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Do what?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Whenever I compliment Simone, you
D  |||  take the credit.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I do?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Yes, you do...
D  |||  (shrug)
D  |||  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Excuse me? Start?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  It's a crowded summer. We need
D  |||  every photo-opp, sound-byte and
D  |||  column inch we can get. Good
D  |||  night, Viktor.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine hangs up. Lainey approaches.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (carefully broaching the
D  |||  subject)
D  |||  Mom, do you miss Dad?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (she thinks)
D  |||  Sometimes. But, just when I think
D  |||  your father's changing for the
D  |||  better, I realize he's as self
D  |||  absorbed as ever. He took the
D  |||  credit for Simone tonight.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
N  |||  Nietzsche book in her hand.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I think Dad deserves more credit
D  |||  than he gets.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen. He is unusually anxious.
E  |||  
N  |||  As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
N  |||  she awaits instructions on the screen. For some reason
N  |||  Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to Simone)
D  |||  Will you cover yourself up!?
E  |||  
N  |||  He hits a button. A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
N  |||  desert. MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  -- I've been here before! -- On my
D  |||  honeymoon with my ex-wife.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Is that why she left you?
E  |||  
N  |||  Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
N  |||  interview. He compares her desert location to the one in
N  |||  front of him.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (pointing out a Joshua
D  |||  tree)
D  |||  You see, that's the exact same tree
D  |||  and in the distance, there's the...
D  |||  (voice trailing away)
D  |||  ... mountain.
E  |||  
N  |||  Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
N  |||  now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
E  |||  
N  |||  Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  It's a hotel.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I don't understand.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  Could they have built that hotel
D  |||  since yesterday?
E  |||  
N  |||  Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Get in the car.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
N  |||  publicity machine. The floor is littered with photographs of
N  |||  SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
E  |||  
N  |||  Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
N  |||  constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
N  |||  spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular
N  |||  Mechanics".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (angrily into phone)
D  |||  -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
D  |||  don't get the cover... written
D  |||  answers to written questions,
D  |||  that's right... website interviews,
D  |||  no problem.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION". Choosing from a HULA
N  |||  DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
N  |||  Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina.
N  |||  She begins to dance for him.
E  |||  
N  |||  He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
N  |||  SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
E  |||  
N  |||  He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
N  |||  With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
N  |||  beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (muttering to himself)
D  |||  You want exposure, Elaine? I'll
D  |||  give you over-exposure...
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE watches TV in her office. She cannot change channels
N  |||  without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic
N  |||  answers.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON ELAINE'S TV)
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I think "Eternity Forever" is my
D  |||  finest work.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I'm most proud of my work in
D  |||  "Eternity Forever".
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I think people are going to love
D  |||  "Eternity Forever".
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in "ETERNITY
N  |||  FOREVER" costume. He speaks to the photo.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Forgive me, Simone.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
N  |||  cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
N  |||  Meals. Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
N  |||  in a convertible.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - DAY
E  |||  
D  |||  "ETERNITY FOREVER" HAS BIG FUTURE AT B.O.!
E  |||  
N  |||  Screams the banner headline in "Variety".
E  |||  
C  |||  $$$IMONE - WINS 6TH WEEKEND IN A ROW
E  |||  
N  |||  Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter".
E  |||  
N  |||  The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR
N  |||  who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly
N  |||  at Simone.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SIMONE INTERVIEW SET - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S TV)
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Of course, being a movie star is
D  |||  wonderful, but I have so many other
D  |||  ways I want to express myself --
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Various book titles are on display:
E  |||  
D  |||  "SIMONE'S FAVORITE SOUTHERN RECIPES"
E  |||  
D  |||  "HUMAN:KIND - The POETRY of SIMONE"
E  |||  
D  |||  "SIMONE'S 101 WAYS TO JOY"
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A banner in a window reads. "In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
N  |||  FASHION". Mannequins model the clothes.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
E  |||  
M  |||  SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
E  |||  
M  |||  PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
E  |||  
N  |||  A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly
N  |||  appears on the screen along with photographs of the
N  |||  artists --
E  |||  
C  |||  PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,
D  |||  CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc. Beneath the title
D  |||  of each song is a graphic representation of the music --
D  |||  "PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor presses a button: "MORPH". The audio waves converge.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song.
N  |||  As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
N  |||  sings. The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
N  |||  Yourself) Believe In Me".
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. RECORD STORE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside
N  |||  the record store. TEENAGE GIRLS, buying CD's, dance
N  |||  adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are
N  |||  gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man.
E  |||  
N  |||  INSERT - "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
N  |||  shoots up the Billboard charts.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. OCEAN - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
N  |||  luxury yacht.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
N  |||  a moment to savor his success. Simone's hit single plays on
N  |||  the yacht's stereo. He looks at peace.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. MARINA - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
N  |||  taken. However, we discover that the Simone is only a
N  |||  lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
N  |||  snapshots. He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
C  |||  ELVIS.
E  |||  
N  |||  MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
E  |||  
N  |||  Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
N  |||  sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Nice boat, Taransky.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  It's a yacht.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I know what you're up to.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (pushing past Max)
D  |||  I don't have time for this, Sayer.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I think you do.
D  |||  (holding up his video
D  |||  print of Simone in the
D  |||  desert)
D  |||  I know it's a fake.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor freezes.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Got your attention now?
E  |||  
N  |||  Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
N  |||  with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (referring to the
D  |||  photographs)
D  |||  It's bogus. You used an old
D  |||  library shot for the background.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (ashen)
D  |||  The background is.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  She was never in New Mexico. She
D  |||  never left the studio.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
N  |||  the background.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (referring to a large
D  |||  bundle of other shots
D  |||  under his arm)
D  |||  I've done my homework. I've
D  |||  studied her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- I bet you have.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  -- I've looked at every piece of
D  |||  publicity she's ever done, the
D  |||  video in the supermarket, there's
D  |||  no evidence she's ever left the
D  |||  studio.
D  |||  (afterthought)
D  |||  Oh, and for some reason this woman
D  |||  leaves no paper trail. But I have
D  |||  "obtained" a copy of your bank
D  |||  accounts. I know you have power of
D  |||  attorney but so far you haven't
D  |||  transferred one single solitary
D  |||  cent to her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm keeping it in trust.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I know that's what you'd like us to
D  |||  believe. But I got to tell you --
D  |||  embezzlement is a serious matter.
D  |||  Not to mention abduction.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Abduction?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I don't buy the whole recluse scam.
D  |||  How are you doing it? What is it --
D  |||  drugs? Blackmail? Mind-control?
D  |||  All three? What do you do -- keep
D  |||  her locked in a box somewhere?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor flinches at the remark.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I want to see her. Unless you show
D  |||  me Simone live and in person I show
D  |||  these pictures to the authorities.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Er,... good.
E  |||  
C  |||  MILTON
D  |||  That's good.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
E  |||  
N  |||  The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
N  |||  into the sea.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  A vast, empty stadium. On the stage, a lone microphone.
N  |||  VIKTOR approaches, gazing out at the vast arena. Several
N  |||  PROMOTERS and TECHNICIANS join him.
E  |||  
C  |||  PROMOTER
D  |||  All ready, Mr. Taransky. This time
D  |||  tomorrow night, she'll be standing
D  |||  right here in front of a packed
D  |||  house. We could have sold it out
D  |||  twenty times.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor nods.
E  |||  
C  |||  TECHNICIAN
D  |||  Soundcheck went perfect. Laser
D  |||  show ready to go.
D  |||  (cautionary note)
D  |||  I gotta say, you ordered an awful
D  |||  lot of smoke.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  That's the way she likes it.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,
N  |||  where a barrier has been erected.
E  |||  
C  |||  PROMOTER
D  |||  After what you told us about the
D  |||  death threats, the security guards
D  |||  are under strict instructions never
D  |||  to take their eyes off the crowd.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Excellent.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a
N  |||  kiss.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Simone wanted you to have these.
E  |||  
C  |||  TECHNICIAN
D  |||  (visibly moved by the
D  |||  gesture)
D  |||  Wish her luck from us.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Oh, I will.
D  |||  (afterthought)
D  |||  Remember, no cameras, no
D  |||  binoculars.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STADIUM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
N  |||  truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
N  |||  from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck. The
N  |||  control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
E  |||  
C  |||  CROWD
D  |||  ... SI-MONE! SI-MONE! SI-MONE!...
E  |||  
N  |||  The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation
N  |||  Tour. NO ENTRY".
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck. On
N  |||  his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting.
E  |||  
C  |||  CROWD
D  |||  ... SI-MONE! SI-MONE! SI-MONE!...
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor produces the "SIMULATION ONE" hard-drive from his
N  |||  jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer.
E  |||  
N  |||  SIMONE appears on the monitor.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Let's get you into hair and make
D  |||  up.
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes
N  |||  grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints
N  |||  across the lids.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Wardrobe.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes
N  |||  appearing to fabricate themselves on her body. He settles
N  |||  for the most provocative outfit.
E  |||  
N  |||  Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor
N  |||  showing --
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE and LAINEY amongst the crowd, clapping their hands,
N  |||  stomping their feet and chanting.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Easier to make one hundred thousand
D  |||  believe than just one.
E  |||  
N  |||  He scrolls to a program, marked "HOLOGRAM" and pushes the
D  |||  "ENTER" key.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  Smoke fills the stage. A strobe light show plays. A booming
N  |||  ANNOUNCER is heard.
E  |||  
C  |||  ANNOUNCER
D  |||  Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor
D  |||  Taransky Promotions is proud to
D  |||  present, live on stage, for the
D  |||  debut concert of the "Splendid
D  |||  Isolation" tour, the one, the only,
C  |||  SI-MONE!
E  |||  
N  |||  A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
N  |||  alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
N  |||  accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage. However, on
N  |||  closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
N  |||  creating a hologram. Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
N  |||  the illusion.
E  |||  
N  |||  The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
N  |||  the enormous video screens on either side of the stage. The
N  |||  CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that
N  |||  they are watching a pre-recorded event. Some watch the event
N  |||  on portable TVs.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  CLOSE UP on the computer screen. VIKTOR scrolls down a list
N  |||  of options -- "... HOUSTON, MIAMI, NEW YORK, L.A...."
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (from on stage)
D  |||  I love you...
E  |||  
N  |||  He selects "L.A.".
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  ... L.A.
E  |||  
N  |||  The crowd roars its approval.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  It's great to be here.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --
N  |||  begins to sing her hit song, "(If You Can't Believe In
N  |||  Yourself) Believe In Me". A verse of the song is sung in
N  |||  perfect Spanish.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A) On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
E  |||  
N  |||  B) On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to
C  |||  SIMONE.
E  |||  
N  |||  C) On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his
N  |||  passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
N  |||  crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
N  |||  tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
N  |||  aloft. For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
N  |||  the grand illusionist. Viktor is at the height of his
N  |||  powers.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to the image of Simone on
D  |||  his screen)
D  |||  I don't know about you, Simone, but
D  |||  I've never felt more alive.
E  |||  
N  |||  He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the
N  |||  Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
N  |||  stand.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Damn!
E  |||  
N  |||  He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the
N  |||  TV screen, apparently fails to notice.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  We focus on a face in the crowd -- MAX SAYER. His
N  |||  journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing
N  |||  along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept
N  |||  up in the moment.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  SIMONE finishes her final number.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Good-night. Never stop believing.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars.
N  |||  FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
E  |||  
N  |||  S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE
N  |||  BOYS. Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"
N  |||  T-shirts and carry posters. Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a
N  |||  TV NEWS CREW.
E  |||  
C  |||  FAN 1
D  |||  -- I swear, she looked right at me.
E  |||  
C  |||  FAN 2
D  |||  -- She was, like, ethereal.
E  |||  
C  |||  FAN 3
D  |||  -- One moment she seemed to walk
D  |||  right through her mike stand like
D  |||  it wasn't even there.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  The chanting crowd can be heard exiting. VIKTOR, wearing
N  |||  lipstick is hastily signing a pile of souvenir programs with
N  |||  Simone's signature kiss.
E  |||  
N  |||  He is interrupted by a knock at the door. Viktor irritably
N  |||  opens it.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I said I didn't want to be
D  |||  interrupt --
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a
N  |||  SECURITY GUARD nearby.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (face brightening)
D  |||  My two favorite girls.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Lainey and I just wanted to
D  |||  congratulate...
E  |||  
N  |||  Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  ... Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She's lying down. She's exhausted.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (suddenly cool)
D  |||  I can imagine.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor is confused by their reaction. Elaine yanks Lainey
N  |||  away.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Thank Simone for the tickets.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (calling back as she is
D  |||  led away)
D  |||  It was a great show, Dad...
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor waves disconcertedly.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Where are you... going?
E  |||  
N  |||  As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
N  |||  lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
N  |||  trailer door. He slams the side of the trailer in
N  |||  frustration.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re-
N  |||  runs of the SIMONE concert. KENT cannot take his eyes off
N  |||  the screen.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I can't believe she's doing this --
D  |||  taking advantage of him this way.
D  |||  It's cruel.
E  |||  
C  |||  KENT
D  |||  Why?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Obviously, this can't last. She's
D  |||  going to dump him. Viktor won't be
D  |||  able to take that. He's too
D  |||  sensitive. It'll destroy him.
E  |||  
C  |||  KENT
D  |||  Elaine, do you realize you can't
D  |||  stop talking about Viktor?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (not hearing)
D  |||  I have to talk to her.
E  |||  
N  |||  Kent switches off the TV.
E  |||  
C  |||  KENT
D  |||  I've been meaning to talk to you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Behind the open door, we find LAINEY eavesdropping.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
N  |||  at the breaking waves. LAINEY joins him.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Hey, Lainey.
D  |||  (gently teasing her)
D  |||  How's your love life?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I do okay. How about you?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You know me -- married to my work.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I noticed.
E  |||  
N  |||  An awkward silence.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Dad, you know I don't like to get
D  |||  between you and mom but she's
D  |||  feeling down right now. She broke
D  |||  up with Kent.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (buoyed by the news)
D  |||  Really? Too bad.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  She thinks you're with Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
D  |||  have a real relationship.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I know but Mom doesn't. Maybe if
D  |||  it came from Simone, if Simone
D  |||  spoke to Mom -- she could
D  |||  straighten things out.
D  |||  (shrug)
D  |||  Dinner, maybe.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A
D  |||  phone call?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Too impersonal. They have to meet
D  |||  face-to-face.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'll see what I can do.
D  |||  (a thought occurs)
D  |||  You know, Lainey. I don't believe
D  |||  you've ever once asked to meet
D  |||  Simone. Don't you like her?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I love her but that doesn't mean I
D  |||  need to meet her.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor is confused.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Why? So I can tell my friends at
D  |||  school -- as if that validates my
D  |||  life somehow. What's Simone going
D  |||  to say to a fourteen-year-old
D  |||  anyhow? She's going to be polite
D  |||  because you're my father but we're
D  |||  not suddenly going to become
D  |||  friends -- we have nothing in
D  |||  common. It's not going to be real.
D  |||  Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
D  |||  my head every day. Why kill the
D  |||  dream? What do they say, "don't
D  |||  get too close to your idols, they
D  |||  always disappoint you".
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
N  |||  her years.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I love you, Lainey.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I love you too, daddy.
E  |||  
N  |||  A car horn sounds outside the house.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  That's Mom.
D  |||  (kissing him on the
D  |||  forehead)
D  |||  See you.
E  |||  
N  |||  She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car
N  |||  radio. ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along
N  |||  the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Her car phone
N  |||  rings. She turns down the radio and picks up.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Hello?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Hello, is this Elaine?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you,
D  |||  Simone?! I've been wanting to talk
D  |||  to you.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Well, here I am.
D  |||  (beat)
D  |||  You look pretty today. Red suits
D  |||  you.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (looking around the
D  |||  freeway)
D  |||  Where are you?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Right beside you. I borrowed
D  |||  Viktor's car.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine looks to the inside lane. SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
N  |||  phone to her ear, drives alongside. Simone waves, somewhat
N  |||  mechanically. Elaine waves back. They keep driving as they
N  |||  talk.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S CAR - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The sunglasses-clad SIMONE is a mannequin, seated in the
N  |||  driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her
N  |||  mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel.
E  |||  
N  |||  Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the
N  |||  car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering
N  |||  with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road
N  |||  ahead. He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm
D  |||  late. I'm on my way to see Viktor
D  |||  now.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  No, I understand. That's what I
D  |||  want to talk about. I don't know
D  |||  if you know this, Simone, but
D  |||  Viktor and I were married once.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  I can't imagine how you ever let a
D  |||  man like that go. I owe Viktor
D  |||  everything.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I think he owes more to you. But
D  |||  that's not important now. I know
D  |||  what's going on between you two.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  I want to reassure you, Elaine,
D  |||  there's absolutely nothing going on
D  |||  between Viktor and I.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (rueful smile)
D  |||  You don't have to protect my
D  |||  feelings, Simone. I don't blame
D  |||  Viktor for falling in love with the
D  |||  most desirable woman in the world.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  (breaking character)
D  |||  I'm not --
D  |||  (correcting himself)
D  |||  He's not.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across
N  |||  his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at
N  |||  the last second.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  My God, are you alright, Simone?
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Damn --
D  |||  (struggling to stay in
D  |||  her/his lane)
D  |||  Yes -- I --
D  |||  (regaining control)
D  |||  -- I'm just a little tired.
D  |||  Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --
D  |||  it's strictly a working
D  |||  relationship. We could never be
D  |||  anything else. We're just so...
D  |||  different.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Exactly. You're a household name
D  |||  now. You're moving in entirely
D  |||  different worlds. That's why I
D  |||  hope you're not toying with Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  It sounds like you still have
D  |||  feelings for him.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  We have a daughter together. I
D  |||  just don't want to see Viktor get
D  |||  hurt.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  I don't know how many times I have
D  |||  to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and
D  |||  I are not in love.
D  |||  (joking weakly)
D  |||  I only make love to the camera.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Simone, I recognize the shirt
D  |||  you're wearing. I gave it to
D  |||  Viktor on his birthday.
E  |||  
N  |||  Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next
N  |||  lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
N  |||  to avoid him.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Christ --
D  |||  (still struggling to stay
D  |||  on the road)
D  |||  Elaine, I know how it looks but...
D  |||  (blurting it out)
D  |||  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor
D  |||  if you'd go with him to the Oscars.
D  |||  If you won't do it for him, please
D  |||  do it for me.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (reluctant, frightened by
D  |||  Simone's erratic driving)
D  |||  Okay -- for you.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  (sigh of relief)
D  |||  Thanks. This is my exit so, I --
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I'm glad we talked.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  Good-bye.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's car swerves to the right. Elaine looks back in her
N  |||  rearview mirror, concerned.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine just misses the sight of VIKTOR's car rear-ending the
N  |||  truck in front of him.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the
N  |||  fender-bender. However, the Patrolman is more interested in
N  |||  the Simone mannequin.
E  |||  
C  |||  PATROLMAN
D  |||  You don't have to explain. I know
D  |||  what the press is like. Lunatics.
D  |||  Out of control.
D  |||  (referring to the Simone
D  |||  mannequin)
D  |||  You do know I'm going to have to
D  |||  take this?
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ACADEMY AWARDS - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed
N  |||  auditorium beside an empty seat -- "RESERVED for SIMONE".
N  |||  ELAINE and LAINEY sit alongside -- LOTUS and MAC nearby.
E  |||  
N  |||  HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best
N  |||  Actress" envelope.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  And the winner is...
E  |||  
N  |||  Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he
N  |||  reads the name.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Actually, there's a tie.
E  |||  
N  |||  The AUDIENCE gasps.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (milking the moment for
D  |||  all it's worth)
D  |||  The winners are... Simone for
D  |||  "Sunrise, Sunset"...
E  |||  
N  |||  The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their
N  |||  applause.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  (big smile)
D  |||  ... and Simone for "Eternity
D  |||  Forever".
E  |||  
N  |||  The audience erupts. Viktor accepts the congratulations of
N  |||  those around him.
E  |||  
C  |||  HAL
D  |||  Unfortunately, Simone can't be with
D  |||  us tonight.
D  |||  (turning to the screen)
D  |||  But thanks to the miracle of modern
D  |||  technology she is able to join us
D  |||  live via satellite from the
D  |||  location of her new film.
E  |||  
N  |||  The screen flickers to life.
E  |||  
C  |||  ON SCREEN - A DESOLATE WASTELAND - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  SIMONE sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland
N  |||  location chosen by Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Thank you! Thank you! This means
D  |||  so much to me. I'm just sorry I
D  |||  can't be there with you.
D  |||  (wiping away a tear)
D  |||  First off I have to acknowledge my
D  |||  fellow nominees -- I don't even
D  |||  feel I belong in the best actress
D  |||  category let alone with these...
D  |||  wonderful human beings.
D  |||  (composing herself)
D  |||  I also have to thank my co-stars,
D  |||  the studio, of course. But most of
D  |||  all, I have to thank the audience
D  |||  for supporting what I do -- you're
D  |||  the only reason I'm here.
E  |||  
N  |||  The CROWD applauds wildly.
E  |||  
N  |||  LAINEY is puzzled. She leans over to Viktor.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Why didn't she thank you?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  She did... didn't she?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (crestfallen)
D  |||  No.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him. The blood
N  |||  drains from his face.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING
E  |||  
N  |||  On the monitor, SIMONE reads the forgotten line from the
N  |||  speech.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  ... And of course I must thank my
D  |||  collaborator, Viktor Taransky,
D  |||  without whom none of this would be
D  |||  possible.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, still in his tuxedo, stares at SIMONE on the screen.
N  |||  He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to himself)
D  |||  It's written right there... Why
D  |||  didn't I say it?... How could I
D  |||  forget to say it?
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone stares back at him blankly.
E  |||  
N  |||  A copy of VARIETY is slid under the soundstage door. The
N  |||  front page headline, "NO THANK YOU - Simone Snubs Taransky At
N  |||  Oscars".
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S CAR - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home. MAX is
N  |||  standing outside next to his car.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Damn it!
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
N  |||  the car, MILTON closeby. Viktor stops at the gate and
N  |||  reluctantly exits his car.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  What now, Sayer?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (smug smile, noticing
D  |||  Viktor noticing the
D  |||  woman)
D  |||  Looks familiar, doesn't she? No
D  |||  one comes from nowhere, Taransky.
D  |||  You turn over enough rocks...
E  |||  
N  |||  The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I traced her to a nursing home. A
D  |||  young woman fitting Simone's
D  |||  description dropped her off five
D  |||  years ago.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She looks a lot like you.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (undeterred)
D  |||  She hasn't uttered a word that
D  |||  whole time -- until she saw the big
D  |||  show.
E  |||  
N  |||  Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
N  |||  front of the old lady.
E  |||  
C  |||  OLD LADY
D  |||  (pointing to Simone's
D  |||  picture, catatonic)
D  |||  My baby... My baby...
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  (putting his hand on his
D  |||  heart)
D  |||  Who would think that "Saint Simone"
D  |||  would abandon her own mother? I've
D  |||  been looking into the family
D  |||  history -- heartbreaking. Most
D  |||  likely a biography to run over four
D  |||  issues... who knows, maybe there's
D  |||  a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in
N  |||  front of the old lady.
E  |||  
C  |||  OLD LADY
D  |||  (pointing to Viktor's face
D  |||  on the driver's license)
D  |||  My baby... My baby...
E  |||  
N  |||  Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  That doesn't prove a thing -- wait
D  |||  until I get a court order for a
D  |||  blood test.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (sensing an opportunity)
D  |||  That won't be necessary.
D  |||  (pretending to be
D  |||  resigned)
D  |||  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack
D  |||  this thing, Max. You got me.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  I do?
D  |||  (recovering)
D  |||  Sure I do.
D  |||  (taking Viktor aside)
D  |||  Can we speak off the record? I'm a
D  |||  fair man. I'm willing to sit down
D  |||  with her and tell her side of the
D  |||  story.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I wouldn't want you to compromise
D  |||  your ethics.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  No. Thanks. Absolutely.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You love her, don't you, Max?
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  Don't you?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (writes a check, hands it
D  |||  to Max)
D  |||  This should take care of Mother.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor drives into his home. Max, very confused, stares at
N  |||  the old lady.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his
N  |||  soundstage. He removes the blindfold. From Lainey's point-
N  |||  of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY
N  |||  FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Happy birthday, Lainey. Do you
D  |||  like it?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (taking in the car)
D  |||  It's fantastic -- it's too much.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  It's the car she drove in "Eternity
D  |||  Forever".
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I know. Thank her for me.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (disappointed by her
D  |||  reaction)
D  |||  It's from both of us. Of course
D  |||  you'll have to drive it around the
D  |||  lot until you get your permit --
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey averts her gaze.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  -- I can't accept it. I don't want
D  |||  a car, Dad.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (clearly hurt, not
D  |||  understanding)
D  |||  Why not? I can get you something
D  |||  else. What do you want?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  The old Viktor Taransky.
D  |||  (finally blurting it out)
D  |||  I liked you better before -- before
D  |||  all this. You were a loser, Dad,
D  |||  but at least you had integrity. I
D  |||  can't stand to see you like this --
D  |||  clinging to Simone's coattails --
D  |||  it used to be about the work, and
D  |||  now it's all about her. And then
D  |||  she's not even grateful enough to
D  |||  thank you.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No, that was me.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  There you go again, blaming
D  |||  yourself. Can't you see what she's
D  |||  done to you -- she's taking
D  |||  advantage, mocking you. You
D  |||  deserve better than Simone.
D  |||  (hasty exit)
D  |||  I've got to go, Dad.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Lainey...
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's
N  |||  remarks. JANE enters.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  Ready for your casting session?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor nods distractedly. Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  Nicola's here for the role of
D  |||  Simone's sister.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has
N  |||  never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
N  |||  Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (slightly uncomfortable by
D  |||  Viktor's scrutiny)
D  |||  A lot's happened since we last saw
D  |||  each other.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (numb)
D  |||  Yes.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  I never apologized properly for
D  |||  what happened on "Sunrise".
E  |||  
N  |||  She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &
N  |||  Ike candy, including cherry.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Thank you. It's not important.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  After I saw what Simone did with
D  |||  the role -- you know I fired all my
D  |||  people, went into rehab, took
D  |||  acting classes, changed my whole
D  |||  look. She really inspired me.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor continues to stare.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (referring to the script
D  |||  in her hands)
D  |||  Would you like me to read?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Yes, I'd like that.
E  |||  
N  |||  Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down.
N  |||  She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the
N  |||  scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (her angry words are in
D  |||  opposition to her amorous
D  |||  actions)
D  |||  -- Who do you think you are, Carlos
D  |||  -- coming in here like this? With
D  |||  my husband sleeping in the next
D  |||  room. Do you think I won't call
D  |||  out? Do you think I will just give
D  |||  in to you without a fight -- like
D  |||  the last time and the time before
D  |||  that?
D  |||  (she kisses his ear)
D  |||  I wish you were dead.
D  |||  (she kisses his lips)
D  |||  I wish we were both dead.
E  |||  
N  |||  Nicola immediately breaks character.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
N  |||  flesh.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (finally able to speak)
D  |||  You know you're really very good.
D  |||  I take back what I said. I mean,
D  |||  you're really good.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  Thank you.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (forgetting himself)
D  |||  You could play the lead.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  But that's Simone's part.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Yes, of course it is.
D  |||  (gazing at her face)
D  |||  You know you have a line here. Not
D  |||  a wrinkle. Actually, more of a
D  |||  dimple. I've been thinking of
D  |||  incorporating something like that
D  |||  in Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  (incredulous)
D  |||  You'd cosmetically alter Simone to
D  |||  look like me?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No, of course not, you're right.
D  |||  That would be crazy.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  Do you want me to do it again?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor does not reply. Nicola quietly leaves.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
N  |||  photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
N  |||  satellite. However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
N  |||  picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
N  |||  Ceremony.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
E  |||  
N  |||  Old home video of ELAINE. She is in a garden by a swimming
N  |||  pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera.
N  |||  Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
N  |||  operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
N  |||  kiss to the camera.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
N  |||  Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
N  |||  monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor freezes the tape. Elaine appears particularly
N  |||  beautiful.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
N  |||  it into Simone. Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
N  |||  dazzling smile.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. SIMONE & VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  At her desk, JANE is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle
N  |||  as she talks on the phone.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  (into phone)
D  |||  -- Oh sure, she comes in all the
D  |||  time... we've become close. She
D  |||  told me --
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR enters the office.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Jane --
E  |||  
N  |||  Jane hurriedly hangs up.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  Gotta go.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (picking up a pile of
D  |||  scripts from the in-tray)
D  |||  I'm leaving early tonight. If you
D  |||  need me I'll be at the beach house
D  |||  having dinner with a... certain
D  |||  someone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Jane tries to conceal her interest. As soon as Viktor exits
N  |||  the office, JANE picks up the phone.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  (into phone, under her
D  |||  breath)
D  |||  ... Elaine Christian please.
E  |||  
N  |||  We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
N  |||  assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music. The doorbell
N  |||  rings.
E  |||  
N  |||  He checks himself in the mirror. In the reflection, he spies
N  |||  an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE.
N  |||  He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
E  |||  
N  |||  ELAINE stands there.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Elaine, it's Wednesday.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (feigning absent
D  |||  mindedness)
D  |||  Is it Wednesday? It's Wednesday.
D  |||  How embarrassing. I don't know
D  |||  what I was thinking. With all the
D  |||  excitement lately...
D  |||  (peering past him)
D  |||  Am I interrupting something? Are
D  |||  you expecting company?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (ushering her inside)
D  |||  As a matter-of-fact I am.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  When is she coming over?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (glancing to his watch)
D  |||  About now. Would you like a drink?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I suppose I could stay, just until
D  |||  she arrives.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine takes a seat on the sofa. Viktor hands her a glass of
N  |||  wine and sits beside her -- close.
E  |||  
N  |||  They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
N  |||  apparently in need of courage.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (trying to make
D  |||  conversation)
D  |||  Is Simone back to earth yet?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Not quite.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I'm sure you'll keep her focussed.
D  |||  She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
D  |||  (blurting out)
D  |||  Is she really having your baby?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Impossible.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (instantly regretting the
D  |||  remark)
D  |||  I just read somewhere --
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I know. I know. They'll say
D  |||  anything.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  -- And she was positively glowing
D  |||  at the awards.
D  |||  (making to leave)
D  |||  I should be going, she'll be here
D  |||  soon --
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- She already is. Simone's not
D  |||  coming over, Elaine. Not tonight,
D  |||  not ever.
D  |||  (holding her)
D  |||  I want you back, Elaine.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (melting)
D  |||  I want you back too, Viktor.
E  |||  
N  |||  They kiss. Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with
N  |||  doubt.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  This is crazy. Who am I fooling?
D  |||  I can't compete with Simone. What
D  |||  woman can?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I would rather have you than
D  |||  Simone. Believe me.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  That's sweet, Viktor, but I
D  |||  couldn't let you do that -- make
D  |||  that kind of sacrifice.
D  |||  (meeting his gaze)
D  |||  It's strange. I've stabbed people
D  |||  in the back, clawed and slept my
D  |||  way to where I am -- it goes with
D  |||  the territory -- but, for some
D  |||  reason, I can't betray Simone.
D  |||  There's... I don't know any other
D  |||  way to say it -- there's a goodness
D  |||  to her.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No, there isn't. There's nothing
D  |||  to her.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Oh, Viktor. You say that now --
D  |||  because we're here, alone, like
D  |||  this. But in the morning, you'd go
D  |||  back to her. What man wouldn't?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No, I will end my relationship with
D  |||  her -- totally.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  But you don't understand. She'll
D  |||  always be there -- at some party,
D  |||  on some magazine cover, some song
D  |||  on the radio, up on some screen.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (desperate)
D  |||  No. She'll never work again --
D  |||  retire, never make a movie or a
D  |||  record, or appear ever again.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (confused)
D  |||  Of course she will. Her public
D  |||  will demand it.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Not if I don't let her.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  You?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I'm going to tell you a secret now,
D  |||  Elaine.
D  |||  (mustering all his nerve)
D  |||  Simone is not a real person. I
D  |||  invented her.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (misinterpreting his
D  |||  remark)
D  |||  Every actor is an invention,
D  |||  Viktor. Don't embarrass yourself.
D  |||  No one's denying that you
D  |||  discovered Simone. But it's like
D  |||  finding a diamond in the desert.
D  |||  Anyone can trip over it, but it's
D  |||  not the finder who sparkles.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (agitated)
D  |||  -- No, no, I didn't trip over her.
D  |||  You don't understand --
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (ignoring him)
D  |||  -- You just got lucky that she's
D  |||  loyal enough to stay with you.
D  |||  Maybe she's staying out of pity,
D  |||  who knows? She certainly doesn't
D  |||  need you. Some people even say
D  |||  you're holding her back.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (wounded)
D  |||  Who says that -- ?
D  |||  (shaking off the insult)
D  |||  -- Never mind. You have to listen
D  |||  to me, Elaine. Simone is thin air,
D  |||  pixels, molded by me from a
D  |||  mathematical equation. I inherited
D  |||  it from a madman -- I can show
D  |||  you --
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  How much wine have you had?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- She's a figment of my own
D  |||  imagination. I, Viktor Taransky,
D  |||  have perpetrated the greatest hoax,
D  |||  the greatest sleight-of-hand,
D  |||  sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
D  |||  sleight in entertainment history!
D  |||  And still no one appreciates me,
D  |||  recognizes what I've done -- even
D  |||  you.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (rolling her eyes)
D  |||  You're drunker than I thought. Are
D  |||  you doing that again?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No! Whatever talent Simone has
D  |||  comes from me -- me! Me! I swear,
D  |||  as God is my judge. You don't know
D  |||  what I've been through. Tens of
D  |||  thousands of mind-numbing hours in
D  |||  front of that screen, nights
D  |||  without end, and look what it's
D  |||  cost me.
D  |||  (producing his spectacles)
D  |||  Why do you think I've been wearing
D  |||  these? I may have done irreparable
D  |||  harm to my eyesight, and why? To
D  |||  extract and refine the infinite
D  |||  nuances of a human being -- a human
D  |||  soul.
D  |||  (a final explanation)
D  |||  Don't you see? I made Simone!
E  |||  
N  |||  A pause. His words hang in the air.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  You made Simone?
D  |||  (a trace of pity)
D  |||  Viktor, she made you.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
N  |||  alone in his house.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office. Suddenly, he stops and
N  |||  confronts the standee of SIMONE.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You bitch! I'll destroy you!
E  |||  
N  |||  JANE stares in shock. She discreetly exits.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
N  |||  SIMONE. He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  MONTAGE:
E  |||  
N  |||  A) Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
N  |||  VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash. Max finds a
N  |||  beat up reel of 16mm film.
E  |||  
N  |||  MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
E  |||  
N  |||  B) The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
N  |||  shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
N  |||  compromising position.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
N  |||  overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
E  |||  
C  |||  WOMAN 1
D  |||  Disgusting...
E  |||  
C  |||  WOMAN 2
D  |||  (sympathetic)
D  |||  She must have been so desperate to
D  |||  do something like that, so
D  |||  depraved.
E  |||  
C  |||  WOMAN 1
D  |||  I'm still naming my baby after her.
E  |||  
C  |||  WOMAN 2
D  |||  You're having a boy.
E  |||  
C  |||  WOMAN 1
D  |||  So?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor blanches. It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
E  |||  
N  |||  C) Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
E  |||  
N  |||  ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
N  |||  farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
N  |||  for muddy vegetables.
E  |||  
N  |||  The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
N  |||  spontaneous applause.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
D  |||  "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
E  |||  
N  |||  D) A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
N  |||  behind him.
E  |||  
C  |||  FILM CRITIC
D  |||  For Simone to do something as brave
D  |||  as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
D  |||  career, with so much to lose -- all
D  |||  I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
D  |||  Oscar".
E  |||  
N  |||  E) In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
N  |||  wrinkles to Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  F) SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
N  |||  on a TV screen. However, her squeaky-clean image has
N  |||  gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
N  |||  during the interview. The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
E  |||  
C  |||  HOST
D  |||  Simone, that's a rather
D  |||  controversial position.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I just think all elementary schools
D  |||  should have a firing range -- so
D  |||  students can learn how to defend
D  |||  themselves. We could fit it
D  |||  inbetween recess and American
D  |||  History.
E  |||  
N  |||  Another clip:
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  If there's a hole in the ozone
D  |||  layer why can't I see it?
E  |||  
N  |||  Another clip:
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Immigration?! God, isn't it
D  |||  crowded enough?!
E  |||  
C  |||  HOSTS
D  |||  Just as we always knew. Simone's
D  |||  not like other celebrities. She
D  |||  speaks her mind!
E  |||  
N  |||  G) VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
N  |||  brakes, almost causing an accident. He stares numbly up
N  |||  at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
N  |||  billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE. It
N  |||  reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to himself)
D  |||  She's trying to kill me.
E  |||  
N  |||  Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  An inscription on a headstone reads:
E  |||  
C  |||  HANK ALENO
D  |||  Remembered Virtually Forever
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave. He places a bunch of flowers
N  |||  there.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (referring to the flowers)
D  |||  They're plastic, Hank. I know
D  |||  that's the way you'd want it.
D  |||  (glancing to a Simone
D  |||  billboard outside the
D  |||  cemetery wall)
D  |||  She killed you, Hank. Now she's
D  |||  killing me. She's a serial killer.
D  |||  (ducking out of sight of
D  |||  the billboard as if
D  |||  Simone is watching him)
D  |||  But I don't know how to stop her.
D  |||  She's taken on a life of her own.
D  |||  I can't just come clean -- make
D  |||  some confession. I've defrauded
D  |||  millions -- they'd turn on me. And
D  |||  I can't put the genie back in the
D  |||  bottle. If she stopped working --
D  |||  dropped out of sight, they'd never
D  |||  let it rest. I've tried to kill
D  |||  her career but they like her even
D  |||  more.
D  |||  (more desperate)
D  |||  What am I going to do, Hank?
E  |||  
N  |||  A thought occurs to Viktor. He slowly rises from behind
N  |||  Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Don't say another word, Hank. You
D  |||  are truly a genius.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,
N  |||  SIMONE's face full screen.
E  |||  
N  |||  He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
N  |||  automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
N  |||  he puts his words in her mouth.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE / VIKTOR
D  |||  What's the matter, Viktor? You
D  |||  look so sad. Don't you love me
D  |||  anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
E  |||  
N  |||  He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  It's the only way, Simone. If it's
D  |||  any consolation, you're going to
D  |||  live on in the public's heart like
D  |||  all the other tragic figures that
D  |||  went before their time. There's no
D  |||  love like posthumous love.
E  |||  
N  |||  On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I know what you're thinking. It's
D  |||  a phoney-baloney world. The women
D  |||  are surgically enhanced, the
D  |||  athletes are on steroids, the
D  |||  singers are lip-syncing if they're
D  |||  even singing at all, the news is
D  |||  entertainment, the politicians are
D  |||  bought and paid for -- we're living
D  |||  one big lie. So why shouldn't you
D  |||  live too? You're more authentic
D  |||  than the people who adore you.
D  |||  (a trace of despair)
D  |||  And that's the problem. You're
D  |||  looking at the real fraud. I told
D  |||  myself this was all about the work
D  |||  but if that was the truth, it
D  |||  wouldn't matter to me -- and it
D  |||  does. It wasn't that the artists
D  |||  had no respect for the art. They
D  |||  had no respect for me. Someone
D  |||  like you, you have so much love
D  |||  showered on you -- I just wanted to
D  |||  feel one tiny drop on my face. I'm
D  |||  sorry, Simone. Here I've been
D  |||  trying to convince the world that
D  |||  you exist, but I was really trying
D  |||  to convince them that I exist.
D  |||  It's not that you aren't human,
D  |||  Simone, it's that I am.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
N  |||  8.1". He places the disc in the machine.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor sees that Simone is crying. He touches a tear on his
N  |||  own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
D  |||  "ENTER". The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
D  |||  deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold.
D  |||  The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
D  |||  like dust. Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
D  |||  digital breath.
E  |||  
N  |||  For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
N  |||  his own desk.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen.
N  |||  His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
N  |||  marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
E  |||  
N  |||  He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
N  |||  hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software. He shuts
N  |||  the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
N  |||  Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing. A mournful pause
N  |||  -- then he heaves it over the side. The trunk sinks like a
N  |||  stone.
E  |||  
N  |||  Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS. A somber VIKTOR
N  |||  enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  It is my sad and solemn duty to
D  |||  announce the tragic passing of
D  |||  Simone.
E  |||  
N  |||  A gasp from the audience. Then, an explosion of anguish.
E  |||  
C  |||  CROWD
D  |||  No!! What happened?! Oh. God.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRESS REPORTER 1
D  |||  (stepping forward,
D  |||  mustering the courage to
D  |||  ask the question)
D  |||  How did she die?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  A rare virus.
D  |||  (pretending to compose
D  |||  himself)
D  |||  On her goodwill tour of the third
D  |||  world.
E  |||  
C  |||  PRESS REPORTER 2
D  |||  Did she suffer?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Mercifully, it was quick.
E  |||  
N  |||  At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON. They are
N  |||  frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
E  |||  
M  |||  A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
E  |||  
N  |||  A) "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
E  |||  
N  |||  B) The announcement of her death appears on local TV news
N  |||  shows around the globe.
E  |||  
N  |||  C) A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several
N  |||  yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property
N  |||  including the driveway. VIKTOR insensitively drives over
N  |||  the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX
N  |||  SAYER and MILTON.
E  |||  
N  |||  D) In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd
N  |||  around a television showing a live picture of Simone's
N  |||  funeral.
E  |||  
N  |||  E) The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral
N  |||  procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the
N  |||  studio lot. Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto
N  |||  the hearse.
E  |||  
N  |||  F) The same television picture is playing on a television
N  |||  sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river. LOCAL WOMEN
N  |||  stop washing their clothes to watch.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an
N  |||  island in a lake.
E  |||  
N  |||  Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
N  |||  from the studio. Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
N  |||  the coffin.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (to Elaine)
D  |||  Can I see you later -- go away for
D  |||  the weekend?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (horrified by the
D  |||  suggestion)
D  |||  How can you bring that up at a time
D  |||  like this?
E  |||  
N  |||  The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum. A
N  |||  PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor. He nods
N  |||  and they start to carry the coffin towards the door.
N  |||  However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
E  |||  
N  |||  A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid. The
N  |||  coffin lid is pulled back. Inside is a life-sized cardboard
N  |||  standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
E  |||  
N  |||  The MOURNERS gasp. Everyone looks to Viktor.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
E  |||  
M  |||  A SERIES OF POLICE INTERVIEWS:
E  |||  
N  |||  JANE sits in the interview room, describing Viktor's assault
N  |||  on the standee.
E  |||  
C  |||  JANE
D  |||  -- I heard him say, "Die bitch".
E  |||  
N  |||  A) MAX SAYER, distraught and weeping.
E  |||  
C  |||  MAX
D  |||  -- He was a controlling madman, she
D  |||  was a prisoner. I blame myself...
D  |||  I should have done more to stop
D  |||  it...
E  |||  
N  |||  B) NICOLA gives a statement.
E  |||  
C  |||  NICOLA
D  |||  -- It was strange. He wanted to
D  |||  replace her with me in his new
D  |||  movie... and I know I'm not that
D  |||  good.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE.
N  |||  Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots,
N  |||  interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards
N  |||  from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls,
N  |||  stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and
N  |||  television appearances.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  -- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky. I'm
D  |||  just trying to understand. All
D  |||  these films, TV appearances,
D  |||  magazine covers, internet
D  |||  interviews, publicity photos,
D  |||  snapshots from her childhood -- all
D  |||  fake.
D  |||  (referring to various
D  |||  items)
D  |||  This is fake, this is fake -- fake,
D  |||  fake, fake, all fake.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  That's right. You understand
D  |||  perfectly. I will confess to
D  |||  fraud, not murder.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  (referring to oversize
D  |||  mail bags)
D  |||  A fan club with a worldwide
D  |||  membership in the millions -- also
D  |||  bogus?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Oh, no. The fan club is real. But
D  |||  they were worshipping computer code
D  |||  -- ones and zeros.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  So, of course, you couldn't kill
D  |||  Simone because there never was a
D  |||  Simone.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Of course.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you
D  |||  talk so much about, a renowned
D  |||  failure, who also happens to be so
D  |||  conveniently dead -- perhaps the
D  |||  "man" you claim helped invent
D  |||  Simone is an invention himself?
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  (patronizing smile)
D  |||  But not everyone's imaginary, are
D  |||  they, Mr. Taransky? I refer, of
D  |||  course, to Edith.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  Who?
E  |||  
N  |||  The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door
N  |||  room where the OLD WOMAN from the rest home is being
N  |||  interviewed.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  The woman you admitted to a
D  |||  journalist is Simone's mother and
D  |||  for whose silence you paid a
D  |||  fortune? Is she not flesh to you --
D  |||  are her tears not wet?
E  |||  
N  |||  The OLD WOMAN glances up and sees all the photos of Simone
N  |||  through the window.
E  |||  
C  |||  OLD LADY
D  |||  My BABY!
E  |||  
N  |||  The Detective abruptly lowers the blind. Viktor rolls his
N  |||  eyes at the Detective's theatrics. He is suddenly enraged.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  She's insane! This whole thing is
D  |||  insane! There is no Simone. Look!
D  |||  (grabbing a Simone poster)
D  |||  Even her name is fake. It's not
D  |||  Simone.
D  |||  (he tears Simone's name in
D  |||  half to demonstrate)
D  |||  It's SIM... ONE! Simulation One!
E  |||  
N  |||  The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE 2
D  |||  (regarding Simone's face
D  |||  also torn in half)
D  |||  You really hated her, didn't you?
E  |||  
N  |||  The Detective places a tape, marked "EXHIBIT A" in a video
N  |||  machine.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  Perhaps you could explain this to
D  |||  me, Mr. Taransky -- or is this tape
D  |||  "doctored" too?
E  |||  
N  |||  He plays a tape showing --
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
N  |||  yacht.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  It's footage from the marina's
D  |||  closed-circuit camera on the night
D  |||  in question. Altered, of course.
D  |||  Is that really what you expect us
D  |||  to believe, Mr. Taransky?
E  |||  
N  |||  The Detective freezes the tape.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  Can you tell us why you were
D  |||  disposing of the body of a woman
D  |||  who didn't exist?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  It wasn't her body. It was her
D  |||  body of work.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  Why don't you just come clean,
D  |||  Viktor? Tell the truth. You'll
D  |||  feel better afterwards.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I am telling the truth.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  (coming close to him)
D  |||  We all know what happened. In a
D  |||  fit of jealous rage you killed
D  |||  Simone and dumped her body off a
D  |||  boat she bought for you.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  No!! I can prove it to you. I'll
D  |||  take you to her.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
N  |||  and his LAWYER. DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk.
N  |||  Viktor's face lights up.
E  |||  
N  |||  The trunk is winched aboard. However, as it lowers onto the
N  |||  deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar. All
N  |||  eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted. Apart from
N  |||  a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (panicky, desperately
D  |||  grabbing the divers)
D  |||  Did you find anything else --
D  |||  drivers, discs... disc-drives?
E  |||  
C  |||  DIVER 1
D  |||  Nothing.
D  |||  (gazing to the water)
D  |||  We couldn't stay down any longer.
E  |||  
N  |||  All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the
N  |||  water.
E  |||  
M  |||  CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:
E  |||  
D  |||  "SIMONE"S BODY FEARED EATEN BY SHARKS"
E  |||  
N  |||  The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting
N  |||  opposite Viktor in his cell. VIKTOR is numb -- the
N  |||  likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAWYER
D  |||  -- Plead guilty and throw yourself
D  |||  on the mercy of the court. It's
D  |||  the best deal you're going to get.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (incredulous)
D  |||  I could get the death penalty.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAWYER
D  |||  You certainly will if you go to
D  |||  trial -- a jury in this kind of
D  |||  ugly mood. You've killed an icon,
D  |||  for God's sake.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,
D  |||  there was no one to kill!
E  |||  
C  |||  LAWYER
D  |||  (musing)
D  |||  An insanity defence.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
E  |||  
N  |||  A FIGURE sits at Viktor's computer. LAINEY. She scrolls
N  |||  through Viktor's files. All empty.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey sighs. ELAINE paces behind her.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Let's go, Lainey. There's nothing
D  |||  here.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Just a minute.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  God, it's so like your father. Why
D  |||  can't people take responsibility
D  |||  for their actions anymore? I can
D  |||  almost forgive him for killing
D  |||  Simone -- but denying her
D  |||  existence. I can never forgive
D  |||  that.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Because obviously she existed,
D  |||  right?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  I know it as surely as you're
D  |||  sitting here, sweetheart. She was
D  |||  the most vital woman I ever met.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  So you did meet her?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Of course. What are you
D  |||  suggesting?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I mean really meet her -- in the
D  |||  flesh.
E  |||  
N  |||  Elaine regards her daughter curiously.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  I know it's embarrassing to admit
D  |||  it, mom, but when I think about it
D  |||  -- honestly, I haven't. I mean, it
D  |||  feels like I have. I know more
D  |||  about her than members of my own
D  |||  family. She's even in my dreams.
D  |||  But I realized, going back through
D  |||  my diary, they were all TV
D  |||  appearances, near misses at
D  |||  parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
D  |||  on the internet. I've never
D  |||  actually seen Simone up close,
D  |||  touched her, been in her physical
D  |||  presence. Have you?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (unable to refute it)
D  |||  Well, I --
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  -- We don't believe daddy because
D  |||  we don't want to believe we were
D  |||  taken in too.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (trying to shake the
D  |||  notion from her head)
D  |||  Lainey, there's no evidence that
D  |||  Simone isn't real.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Listen to what you're saying, mom.
D  |||  Is there any evidence she is?
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey finally tries another file. She presses "EJECT". The
D  |||  "PLAGUE" disc spits out of the machine.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (regarding the disc)
D  |||  There's one part of dad's story
D  |||  that may have been true. Simone
D  |||  may have contracted a virus.
E  |||  
N  |||  Lainey smiles at her mother.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  Certain viruses can be cured.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - POLICE CELL - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething,
N  |||  while his LAWYER lays out his trial strategy.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAWYER
D  |||  (hushed tones, referring
D  |||  to a thick Psychiatric
D  |||  Report)
D  |||  ... Listen, I've found a
D  |||  psychiatrist in Ventura -- well
D  |||  respected -- who's willing to
D  |||  testify under oath that you have
D  |||  diminished capacity due to the
D  |||  trauma of your divorce, ten years
D  |||  of abject failure in the movie
D  |||  business and a bump on the head you
D  |||  sustained as a child --
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR, fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  -- No! I can't go along with this
D  |||  horseshit! Just tell them they can
D  |||  fry me!
E  |||  
C  |||  LAWYER
D  |||  (aghast, looking around to
D  |||  see if anyone has heard)
D  |||  What?!
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  It was premeditated -- I knew
D  |||  exactly what I was doing! I
D  |||  strangled her! I bludgeoned her!
D  |||  I set her on fire! I did it! I
D  |||  killed her!
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE (O.S.)
D  |||  (clearing his throat)
D  |||  Excuse me.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Lawyer spins around guiltily. The Detective stands
N  |||  outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession.
N  |||  Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  I think you'd better see this.
E  |||  
N  |||  The Detective switches on the TV set hanging outside the
N  |||  cell. VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" --
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - "VBC" - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
E  |||  
N  |||  A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
E  |||  
C  |||  VBC ANCHOR
D  |||  (from TV)
D  |||  -- Breaking news -- international
D  |||  media star, Simone, is alive and
D  |||  well. Her studio released this
D  |||  footage only minutes ago...
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
E  |||  
N  |||  The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times --
N  |||  headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE"
N  |||  and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
E  |||  
N  |||  The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
N  |||  on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever. She
N  |||  winks to the camera.
E  |||  
C  |||  VBC ANCHOR
D  |||  ... Simone reading today's edition
D  |||  of the L.A. Times. Who says, "The
D  |||  only bad publicity is your
D  |||  obituary"? Details at the top of
D  |||  the hour.
E  |||  
N  |||  The TV is switched off. Viktor stares at the screen, trying
N  |||  to take it in.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  You're indestructible.
E  |||  
N  |||  When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding
N  |||  the cell door open.
E  |||  
C  |||  DETECTIVE
D  |||  (shaking his head in pity)
D  |||  I'll never get you Hollywood
D  |||  people.
E  |||  
M  |||  EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a
N  |||  sea for VIKTOR, released from custody. One placard reads,
D  |||  "ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW". He is escorted to a waiting
D  |||  limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY. He hugs them
D  |||  both.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE. LAINEY sits opposite, studying
N  |||  her laptop computer. Outside the car, REPORTERS are pressed
N  |||  against the glass.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (relaxing back into his
D  |||  seat)
D  |||  Thank you!
D  |||  (to Lainey)
D  |||  I don't know how you did it but
D  |||  thank you.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (putting her arm around
D  |||  him)
D  |||  Don't thank us too fast, Viktor.
D  |||  You know what we have to do?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (resigned smile)
D  |||  Why stop at one character when you
D  |||  can have a whole cast?
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  Exactly. Now that you have the
D  |||  studio behind you, we can really do
D  |||  things.
E  |||  
N  |||  Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (holding Viktor close)
D  |||  I was thinking -- what about you
D  |||  and... "Simone" moving back in with
D  |||  me and Lainey?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (meeting her gaze)
D  |||  That sounds wonderful.
D  |||  (to Lainey)
D  |||  How do you feel about all this,
D  |||  Lainey?
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (beaming)
D  |||  About you and mom?
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (reluctant admission)
D  |||  Me and Simone. What I did.
E  |||  
C  |||  LAINEY
D  |||  (sweet smile)
D  |||  Your mistake wasn't making
D  |||  something fake, daddy. We're fine
D  |||  with fake -- as long as you don't
D  |||  lie about it.
E  |||  
N  |||  Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth.
N  |||  Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually
N  |||  forces its way through the reporters.
E  |||  
N  |||  He recognizes MAX and MILTON amongst the mob. Max has
N  |||  hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the
N  |||  window --
E  |||  
D  |||  "WILL PAY $ FOR EXCLUSIVE". Viktor looks away.
E  |||  
C  |||  ELAINE
D  |||  (kissing him on the cheek)
D  |||  Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's
D  |||  not a death sentence.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (still staring out of the
D  |||  window, a rueful smile)
D  |||  No... it's life.
E  |||  
M  |||  INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - DAY
E  |||  
N  |||  FRANK BRAND conducts a remote interview with SIMONE who
N  |||  appears as usual on a television monitor.
E  |||  
C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  -- Simone, the question on
D  |||  everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  Frank, you know as well as I do,
D  |||  living in a fish bowl, the
D  |||  insatiable appetite of the media...
E  |||  
N  |||  Frank nods sympathetically.

D  |||  With everything that was going on
D  |||  in my life, I just needed to drop
D  |||  out of sight for a while -- I
D  |||  needed time. Viktor bought me that
D  |||  time. I owe him so much.

D  |||  We all do.
D  |||  (quickly returning to
D  |||  Simone)
D  |||  But now I understand you're eager
D  |||  to get back to work -- and not the
D  |||  kind of work that we're all
D  |||  expecting.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  (smiles coyly)
D  |||  That's true. I can reveal that I
D  |||  am considering a career in
D  |||  politics.

C  |||  FRANK BRAND
D  |||  And what may I ask brought this on?

N  |||  SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
E  |||  
C  |||  SIMONE
D  |||  I suppose this little man had
D  |||  something to do with it. Viktor
D  |||  and I are both concerned about what
D  |||  kind of world our new son, Chip, is
D  |||  going to grow up in.
D  |||  (turning lovingly to
D  |||  Viktor)
D  |||  Aren't you, Viktor?

N  |||  On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal
N  |||  VIKTOR, sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene.
E  |||  
C  |||  VIKTOR
D  |||  (turning lovingly to
D  |||  Simone)
D  |||  Yes.

N  |||  Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded.
N  |||  VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his
N  |||  soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there --
N  |||  he is alone.
